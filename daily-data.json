The latest XRP (XRP) price prediction has stunned many with a $100 target set by Alpha Lions Academy founder Edoardo Farina. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues its aggressive burn strategy, destroying 881 million tokens through its ShibTorch initiative and fueling long-term deflationary interest. These developments are capturing headlines, but investors are also beginning to notice <a href=\"http://unstaked.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unstaked</a>: a sub-cent presale project that is gaining traction thanks to its live rollout and structured roadmap. For those tracking the most popular crypto coins right now, all three are entering new, potentially critical phases.</p>\n<h2><b>XRP Aims for Long-Term Growth with Ambitious $100 Price Target</b></h2>\n\n<p><span>XRP’s position in the crypto spotlight is intensifying after high-profile investor Edoardo Farina shared his bullish outlook on the coin’s track. The Alpha Lions Academy founder believes that a $1,000 investment today could grow into $50,000 if XRP reaches his target price of $100 per token. Though it currently trades near $2, Farina asserts that XRP is at the center of a “multi-generational pump,” citing its relevance in global finance infrastructure and potential future utility.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Farina’s position doesn’t come without scrutiny. Critics have raised eyebrows at the idea of a 5,000% rally pointing out that such gains, though technically feasible, would require significant regulatory clarity and widespread adoption. Still, the optimism has ignited fresh debate around XRP (XRP) price prediction models. Some traders have countered Farina’s outlook with more conservative takes, noting that even a jump to $5 or $10 would still be transformative for long-term holders.</span></p>\n<p><span>Farina has also suggested that owning fewer than 1,000 XRP tokens may reflect a lack of conviction in financial growth. While this perspective has been polarizing, it underscores growing belief within parts of the XRP community that the asset remains undervalued relative to its use case potential. With XRP continuing to be discussed among the most popular crypto coins, its future hinges not just on speculation, but on broader adoption in payment systems and institutional networks.</span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-25-132255.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-25-132255.jpg 1280w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-25-132255-300x200.jpg 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-25-132255-600x400.jpg 600w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-25-132255-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"></p>\n<h2><b>Shiba Inu Burn Strategy Strengthens Long-Term SHIB Price Potential</b></h2>\n<p><span>Shiba Inu is drawing attention once again, not for viral memes, but for its aggressive token burn strategy. In just 24 hours, over 11 million SHIB were burned, contributing to a weekly total of more than 142 million. ShibTorch and tracking site Shibburn reported a staggering 3,277% daily spike in the burn rate, signaling renewed community engagement aimed at reducing supply and supporting long-term Shiba Inu (SHIB) price potential.</span></p>\n<p><span>One standout moment came via Shibarium Updates, which highlighted a single-day burn of 881 million tokens, reinforcing SHIB’s deflationary momentum. Alongside these efforts, SHIB’s marketing lead Lucie has issued warnings against scams and hype-driven behavior, encouraging the community to prioritize education and long-term thinking.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unstaked.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/c12e1x2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1193\" height=\"149\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/c12e1x2.png 1193w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/c12e1x2-300x37.png 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/c12e1x2-800x100.png 800w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/c12e1x2-768x96.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1193px) 100vw, 1193px\"></a></p>\n<p><span>As SHIB continues to evolve beyond its meme coin origins, it’s carving a more strategic role in the market. With rising burn activity and ongoing community efforts, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price potential story is gaining credibility. Among popular crypto coins, SHIB stands out for its mix of grassroots action and consistent execution.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><b>Why Unstaked Is Drawing Investor Attention at $0.0065</b></h2>\n<p><span>As major assets like XRP and SHIB gain traction, another project is quietly making its case among forward-looking investors: Unstaked. Priced at just $0.0065 in public presale, Unstaked is building a utility-focused crypto platform centered around AI agents designed to power community engagement across Telegram, X, and other <a>Web3</a> channels.</span></p>\n<p><span>This isn’t a whitepaper pitch; the roadmap is already live. Q2 2025 marks the deployment of Unstaked’s <a>dApp</a> and initial agent rollout. Q3 will introduce a performance-based rewards system, rewarding users based on measurable outcomes. In Q4, social integrations with Discord and Instagram will go live, followed by <a>NFT</a>-based customization tools in Q1 2026. This phased approach gives investors clear visibility into product development while maintaining a low-cost entry point.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unstaked.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-25-132253.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-25-132253.jpg 1280w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-25-132253-300x169.jpg 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-25-132253-711x400.jpg 711w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-25-132253-768x432.jpg 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-25-132253-915x515.jpg 915w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"></a></p>\n<p><span>In a market full of late-cycle entries and recycled narratives, Unstaked offers a rare opportunity: public access to an early-stage product with structured delivery and transparent growth goals. It’s no surprise then that Unstaked is starting to be mentioned alongside the most popular crypto coins of 2025, even before its official launch.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Closing Word</b></h2>\n<p><span>XRP’s price projection to $100 may be ambitious, but it reflects growing belief in its long-term relevance. Shiba Inu’s burn campaigns and anti-scam education mark it as a maturing ecosystem with rising fundamentals. And then there’s Unstaked; still under a penny, already deploying product, and shaping up as one of the most investor-aligned opportunities in the current market.</span></p>\n<p><span>As the search continues for the best crypto strategies, it’s becoming clear that timing and positioning will define the winners of this cycle. And Unstaked, with its presale access and measurable rollout, might just be where smart money is starting to look next.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unstaked.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/qew.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1193\" height=\"149\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/qew.png 1193w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/qew-300x37.png 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/qew-800x100.png 800w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/qew-768x96.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1193px) 100vw, 1193px\"></a></p>\n<p>Presale: <a href=\"https://presale.unstaked.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://presale.unstaked.com/</a></p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://unstaked.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://unstaked.com/</a></p>\n<p>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/UnstakedTokenOfficial\">https://t.me/UnstakedTokenOfficial</a></p>\n<p>X: <a href=\"https://t.me/UnstakedTokenOfficial\">https://t.me/UnstakedTokenOfficial</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span><em><strong>This publication is sponsored.

The move reflects ongoing concerns about <a href=\"https://levin.house.gov/media/press-releases/democratic-lawmakers-call-for-transparency-on-member-stock-trading-during-trumps-economic-chaos-demand-ban-be-considered-by-house\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">financial transparency</a> and ethics among U.S. lawmakers.</p>\n\n<p>Prohibiting Congressional stock activities could lead to increased <strong>trust in government</strong> and emphasize a commitment to ethical standards. While aimed at legislative behavior, <strong>knock-on effects</strong> could emerge in <strong>capital markets</strong> related to transparency. Experts believe that a ban on congressional trading might fortify ethical standards. As Donald Trump mentioned, “If they put that bill in front of me, I will sign it.”</p>\n<p>Democratic lawmakers support immediate legislative action, highlighting the need for <strong>financial ethics</strong>. Interestingly, <strong><a href=\"https://coincu.com/325958-trumps-crypto-policy-raises-concerns-eu/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://coincu.com/325958-trumps-crypto-policy-raises-concerns-eu/\">no significant crypto leaders have publicly reacted to this announcement</a></strong>, keeping market impacts confined to U.S. equities for now.</p>\n<h2>Echoes of Past Ethics Debates in Washington</h2>\n<p>\n    <strong>Did you know?</strong> Previous Congressional stock trading controversies triggered debates on ethics, yet similar reforms have faced many <strong>delays in the past</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>Past issues involving Congress’s stock activities have sparked public outcry, leading to calls for reform. This proposed ban highlights the increasing focus on <strong>political and financial ethics</strong> within the U.S. government.</p>\n\n<p>Experts point out that while crypto markets remain unaffected, the broader emphasis on <strong>transparency</strong> could drive long-term regulatory changes. Though without immediate data shifts, the <strong><a href=\"https://coincu.com/326017-sec-delays-spot-crypto-etf-decisions/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://coincu.com/326017-sec-delays-spot-crypto-etf-decisions/\">regulatory landscape might eventually impact</a></strong> how markets operate globally.

The trial, led by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, follows years of scrutiny over Meta’s dominance and could reshape the future of digital platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meta’s defense hinges on proving that the competitive landscape has drastically changed, with rivals like TikTok, YouTube and iMessage now commanding massive audiences. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company says the FTC is relying on an outdated view of the market and argues the lawsuit sets a dangerous precedent by reopening approved mergers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A breakup would slash Meta’s U.S. advertising revenue, half of which comes from Instagram alone, analysts say. WhatsApp also plays a crucial role in Meta’s pivot toward private messaging and international markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meta maintains that the FTC must prove current monopoly power in a fragmented and evolving tech space. The Commission contends that Meta strategically crushed potential competitors, buying up innovators to preserve its dominance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trial could redefine antitrust enforcement in the digital age, as Google and Amazon face similar legal action. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A decision may have sweeping consequences for U.S. tech regulation and global digital competition.</p>\n                        \n                    \n                    <p><a href=\"http://www.copyscape.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://banners.copyscape.com/img/copyscape-banner-black-200x25.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"25\" alt=\"Protected by Copyscape\" title=\"Protected by Copyscape - Do not copy content from this page.\" data-src=\"//banners.copyscape.com/img/copyscape-banner-black-200x25.png\"></a>        \n                </p></div></div>",

The city has made it easy for locals and visitors to use digital currencies with over 150 crypto ATMs spread across town.&nbsp;</p><p>Many local shops also accept crypto as payment, which makes it easy for people to use digital money every day, boosting the city’s reputation as a crypto-friendly hub.</p><p>Local support has played a big role in Ljubljana’s rise as a crypto leader.

This development sharply increased investor optimism, as the presence of a Grayscale trust legitimizes SUI in the eyes of many traditional players. Around the same time, the Sui Foundation unveiled a strategic partnership with xPortal and xMoney to issue a virtual Mastercard linked to the <a>altcoin</a>​.</p>\n<p>This integration allows roughly 2.5 million European users to spend SUI tokens at over 20,000 merchants via Apple Pay and Google Pay​.</p>\n\n\n<p>By <strong><a href=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=74701&amp;action=edit\">expanding</a></strong> SUI’s real-world utility, the Mastercard news bolstered market sentiment and broadened Sui’s appeal beyond crypto trading circles. Together, the Grayscale trust launch and the Mastercard partnership have been pivotal catalysts, injecting confidence and attracting a wave of new buyers to its market.</p>\n<h2><a>On-Chain</a> Metrics Show Ecosystem Booming</h2>\n<p>Beyond headline news, on-chain data from the Sui network reveals a rapidly growing ecosystem, which has reinforced the bullish price action. Sui’s total value locked (<a>TVL</a>) in decentralized finance has surged by about 38–40% in the past week, reaching roughly $1.6–$1.65 billion​.</p>\n<p>This jump to new highs in TVL signals that users are increasingly locking assets into Sui-based <a>DeFi</a> protocols, reflecting rising confidence in the network’s utility. Likewise, daily trading volumes on Sui’s decentralized exchanges have exploded – about $580–$600 million in <a>DEX</a> volume over the last 24 hours, up 167–177% week-over-week​.</p>\n<p>Such a spike in activity suggests a flood of <a>liquidity</a> and user engagement in Sui’s ecosystem, which in turn drives demand for the token. Even the broader Sui ecosystem growth has been impressive. The supply of stablecoins on Sui’s network has climbed from roughly $482 million to $879 million over the past two months – an 82% increase that underscores greater on-chain liquidity and usage​.</p>\n<p>Additionally, developers and traders have been launching new projects on Sui. Notably, a wave of Sui-based meme coins saw explosive gains in recent days, drawing speculators to the network. For example, tokens like LOFI and BLUB (built on Sui) jumped 143% and 57% respectively in the past week​.</p>\n<p>This kind of speculative frenzy on Sui’s own platforms has helped boost network activity (and awareness), creating a positive feedback loop that benefited SUI’s price. All these on-chain metrics point to an ecosystem on the rise, providing fundamental support to SUI’s market rally.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Social Media Buzz and Investor Sentiment</h2>\n<p>The market sentiment around Sui turned overwhelmingly positive as these developments unfolded, with social media chatter amplifying the rally. On crypto X, the altcoin became a hot topic. In fact, Sui’s weekly performance of over +70% made it the top gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, drawing significant attention.</p>\n<p>Traders and influencers highlighted how SUI had suddenly leap-frogged more established projects in market capitalization. “Grayscale just launched a trust, social chatter is exploding, and it’s [SUI] now sitting above AVAX and LINK in <a>market cap</a>,” noted one popular analyst on April 24​.</p>\n<p>Such commentary encapsulates the <a>FOMO</a> (fear of missing out) that began driving the market, as both everyday crypto enthusiasts and bigger investors appeared to be piling into the altcoin. Moreover, a intriguing rumor has been circulating that further fueled enthusiasm: speculation of a potential connection between Sui and the Pokémon franchise. This rumor arose after eagle-eyed community members noticed that Parasol Technologies – a <a>Web3</a> game developer acquired by Mysten Labs (Sui’s creator) – was listed in a recent update to the Pokémon HOME app’s privacy policy​.</p>\n<p>The mere hint of a Pokémon collaboration was enough to send excitement through both the gaming and crypto communities. While neither Mysten Labs nor The Pokémon Company have confirmed any joint project, the speculation put Sui in the spotlight and likely contributed to additional speculative buying of tokens​.</p>\n\n\n<p>Overall, the combination of factual positive news and tantalizing rumors created a bullish narrative on social media, boosting investor sentiment markedly in the last 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>Technical Breakout on the Charts</h2>\n<p>From a technical analysis perspective, SUI’s price action in late April signaled a decisive bullish breakout. Earlier this week, SUI had already broken above key resistance levels – notably its 21-day and 50-day moving average lines – for the first time since early 2025​.</p>\n<p>This marked an end to the multi-month downtrend SUI had been in, and hinted that a trend reversal was underway. By April 25, the rally pushed SUI’s price even above the 200-day moving average (around $3.00), a long-term technical benchmark that traders often watch as a sign of a major trend shift​.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-25-at-15.34.13.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2108\" height=\"1442\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-25-at-15.34.13.png 2108w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-25-at-15.34.13-300x205.png 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-25-at-15.34.13-585x400.png 585w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-25-at-15.34.13-768x525.png 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-25-at-15.34.13-1536x1051.png 1536w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-25-at-15.34.13-2048x1401.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2108px) 100vw, 2108px\"></p>\n<p>Clearing the 200-day <a>MA</a> is a bullish feat that put SUI back on an upward trajectory not seen in months. Momentum indicators confirm the strength of this move. SUI’s daily Relative Strength Index (<a>RSI</a>) climbed into the 70s on April 25 – a level indicative of very strong momentum (albeit near overbought territory)​.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (<a>MACD</a>) indicator recently flashed a bullish crossover (with the MACD line crossing above the signal line) on April 22, confirming the shift to upward momentum​.</p>\n<p>Trading volumes have correspondingly risen alongside price, which gives the breakout credibility (high volume breakouts are seen as more reliable)​. Chart analysts note that SUI has now broken out of its prior consolidation range and is approaching the next significant resistance levels. Having surpassed $3, some are eyeing the early-2025 highs near $5 as a potential upside target if the current momentum persists​.</p>\n<p>The price action on April 25 showed a series of higher highs and higher lows intraday, a classic pattern of a sustained uptrend, which bodes well for the token’s short-term technical outlook.</p><!-- CONTENT END 1 -->\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://t.me/coindoo_media\">\n        <img alt=\"telegram\" width=\"932\" height=\"236\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/themes/coinpress/images/Banner_en-US_Poppins_new.png\">\n    </a>\n</p><section>\n    <span>Author</span>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n                                <p><img width=\"298\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/photo_2025-03-25_16-09-58-298x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/photo_2025-03-25_16-09-58-298x300.jpg 298w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/photo_2025-03-25_16-09-58-398x400.jpg 398w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/photo_2025-03-25_16-09-58-768x772.jpg 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/photo_2025-03-25_16-09-58.jpg 1170w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px\">                </p>\n                                            \n            </div>\n                <p>Kosta has been a part of the team since 2021 and has solidified his position with a thirst for knowledge, incredible dedication to his work and a \"detective-like\" mindset.

      "content": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div>\n    <p>A March 31 <a href=\"https://finbold.com/\">Finbold</a> report found that <a href=\"https://finbold.com/guide/how-much-money-does-elon-musk-make-a-second/\">Elon Musk’s</a> tenure with the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) coincided with a <a href=\"https://finbold.com/over-40-of-dogecoin-millionaires-wiped-out-since-elon-musk-began-d-o-g-e/\">40% decline</a> in the number of <a href=\"https://finbold.com/guide/fastest-way-to-buy-dogecoin/\">Dogecoin</a> (<a href=\"https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin\">DOGE</a>) millionaire addresses, with the billionaire’s <a href=\"https://finbold.com/is-elon-musk-now-killing-dogecoin-doge/\">historical influence</a> on the meme coin hinting at causation rather than mere correlation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, on April 8, a process was initiated that culminated in the businessman announcing the winding down of D.O.G.E. involvement, due to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/business/elon-musk-peter-navarro-comments-tariffs/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a tariff spat</a> with Pete Navarro, President <a href=\"https://finbold.com/guide/donald-trump-net-worth/\">Donald Trump’s</a> trade advisor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By April 25, Finbold Research had found that Musk’s anticipated exit led to the emergence of 183 new DOGE millionaires – a 14.33% increase compared to April 8, the starting date of mounting tensions between Elon Musk, the Trump administration, and their joint government efforts via D.O.G.E.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, the number of addresses holding between $1 million and $9.99 million worth of Dogecoin increased from 1,082 to 1,223 since the initial reported dispute, while the number of those worth $10 million or more rose by 21.54% from 195 to 237.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-musk-s-involvement-with-d-o-g-e-impacted-doge\">How Musk’s involvement with D.O.G.E. impacted DOGE</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The comparison with both March 31 and April 8 demonstrates that the total number of DOGE millionaires first dropped from 1,366 to 1,277 and then increased to 1,460, demonstrating that the direction hasn’t been entirely steady.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, the period also saw a dramatic change in Dogecoin’s <a href=\"https://finbold.com/cryptocurrencies/\">cryptocurrency market</a> performance. Between March 31 and April 8, DOGE’s price dropped from $0.167 to a low of $0.142, and the meme coin’s market capitalization plunged from approximately $24 billion to about $19.7 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between April 8 and press time on April 25, however, Dogecoin’s price rallied 27.46% to $0.181, and the cryptocurrency’s market cap increased by some $7.1 billion as it climbed to just under $27 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-elon-musk-s-historical-impact-on-dogecoin\">Elon Musk’s historical impact on Dogecoin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Elon Musk’s historical impact cannot be dismissed, as the billionaire has served as a relatively regular trigger for major price swings since he first described Dogecoin as his favorite such cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the impact the South African-Canadian-American billionaire has had on assets closely associated with him is amply demonstrated by the issues <a href=\"https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-tesla-stock/\">Tesla</a> (NASDAQ: <a href=\"https://finbold.com/stock/tesla-tsla/\">TSLA</a>) has faced in the stock market and on the business side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a report published on April 24, Finbold research <a href=\"https://finbold.com/tesla-sold-just-600-vehicles-per-day-in-europe-during-q1-2025/\">revealed</a> that the first quarter (Q1) of 2025 has been especially weak for the electric vehicle (<a href=\"https://finbold.com/guide/top-5-ev-stocks-to-buy/\">EV</a>) maker is witnessed a 37.2% year-over-year (YoY) drop in sales in Europe, with Musk’s controversial political engagements being a likely driver for the disappointing numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, internationally, the billionaire has courted controversy, for example, by <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-endorses-germanys-far-right/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">endorsing</a> divisive political parties. In the U.S., allegations of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/musks-doge-using-ai-snoop-us-federal-workers-sources-say-2025-04-08/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">monitoring</a> government employees for anti-Trump sentiment using artificial intelligence (<a href=\"https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-invest-in-ai-stocks/\">AI</a>) have been just some of the many actions that have cost him approval.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-elon-musk-s-2025-impact-on-dogecoin\">Elon Musk’s 2025 impact on Dogecoin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of Dogecoin, the situation isn’t as clear. Not only has the price of the meme coin increased significantly more than the number of millionaire addresses, but other factors such as the latest across-the-board rally and cryptocurrencies’ increasing correlation with <a href=\"https://finbold.com/guide/buy-gold-with-wise/\">gold</a>, one of 2025’s best-performing investments, are also in play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, it is difficult to miss that the alleged Musk-Trump dispute marked a low point for Dogecoin, and the road has been overwhelmingly positive since then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Featured image via Shutterstock</strong></em></p>  </div></div>",
