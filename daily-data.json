It shows that the ETH price has been in a downtrend, hence a lower low has been made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the relative strength index (RSI) has produced a higher low during the same period. Such a trend suggests that bearish pressure is gradually fading. This situation is typical before a reversal of the price movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to technical experts, this could translate to quite a reversal. That’s why there is a possibility of seeing a higher price rebound in the Ethereum price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some analysts predict that ETH can increase by almost 120% and actively move towards the value of $2,500. This increase, if sustained, could trigger more increases in the target area of over $4000 over the longer term.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"624\" src=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-108-1024x624.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-108-1024x624.png 1024w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-108-300x183.png 300w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-108-768x468.png 768w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-108-1536x936.png 1536w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-108-150x91.png 150w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-108-696x424.png 696w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-108-1068x651.png 1068w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-108.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>Source: X</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the Ethereum price action has recently breached a key trendline support level. This trendline break, combined with the bullish divergence, provided further confirmation that a shift in market direction may occur soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A clear breakout above the current resistance zones could trigger an influx of buying activity.

Data shows that in just one day, Ethereum ETFs saw a remarkable inflow of 41,940 ETH, worth approximately $76.33 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the largest contributors, BlackRock added 37,537 ETH. That reflected the growing institutional interest in the top altcoin.

      "content": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><article id=\"post-6993\">\n\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">4-5-2025 – The cryptocurrency XRP is staging a remarkable resurgence, poised for a potential breakout, according to incisive technical analyses circulating in the crypto sphere. TradingView’s renowned analyst, ‘The Signalyst’, has heralded XRP’s return to form, spotlighting its promising trajectory within a well-defined ascending channel. This pattern, marked by a steady cadence of higher highs and higher lows, underscores a robust medium-term bullish trend, igniting optimism among investors.</p>\n\n<p>A focal point of this analysis is XRP’s current dance with a critical demand zone, vividly marked in green on price charts. This region, a historical bastion of support and resistance, has repeatedly rebuffed downward pressure, cementing its significance. The Signalyst draws particular attention to a pivotal confluence where this horizontal support intersects with the lower boundary of the rising channel, circled in blue on the chart. This alignment of diagonal and horizontal supports amplifies the prospect of a bullish surge, positioning the zone as a prime hunting ground for buy signals. The analyst remains vigilant, poised to detect telltale reversal patterns—such as a double bottom or a trendline break—that could herald XRP’s next upward leap.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, the XRP narrative extends beyond this bullish setup, with whispers of a more dramatic arc. Crypto analyst JD, sharing insights on X, has unearthed technical signals reminiscent of XRP’s meteoric rise in 2017. Pointing to the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (SRSI), which recently breached the 80 threshold, JD flags a momentum surge not witnessed since that historic rally. Back then, this crossover presaged a staggering 20-fold increase, propelling XRP past $3 before a brutal 90% plunge. While JD tempers expectations, noting that XRP’s larger market cap precludes a repeat of such exponential gains, he anticipates a potent rally followed by a sharp 70% correction, heralding a phase of heightened volatility.</p>\n<!-- CONTENT END 1 -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\t\n\t\t\t</article></div>",

      "title": "The Logistics Firm Going All-In on Trump Tokens: A High-Risk Bet to Save Its Stock",
      "content": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><article id=\"post-6990\">\n\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">4-5-2025 – Freight Technologies (FRGT), a logistics technology firm with a modest $4.8 million market cap, has embarked on an audacious financial strategy by committing to acquire up to $20 million in Official Trump Tokens (TRUMP). The company, which specialises in streamlining trade across the U.S.-Mexico border, aims to bolster its cryptocurrency treasury with this move, positioning itself as a trailblazer among publicly listed firms embracing digital assets. The initial funding, secured through a $1 million tranche from a convertible note facility with an institutional investor, will be exclusively channelled into purchasing TRUMP tokens.</p>\n\n<p>This bold step follows Freight Technologies’ earlier foray into cryptocurrencies, with an $8 million investment in FET tokens tied to artificial intelligence, which powers the company’s suite of logistics platforms. These platforms, encompassing freight booking and transportation management tools, are designed to modernise the flow of goods across North America, particularly between the U.S. and Mexico, the latter being America’s foremost trading partner for both exports and imports.</p>\n<p>The decision to amass TRUMP tokens is not merely a financial gambit but carries a strategic intent. Javier Selgas, Freight Technologies’ CEO, framed the acquisition as a dual-purpose endeavour: diversifying the company’s crypto holdings while advocating for equitable trade policies amid escalating tensions in U.S.-Mexico relations. “This investment reflects our commitment to fostering fair and open commerce,” Selgas declared on 30 April, underscoring the company’s mission to strengthen cross-border economic ties.</p>\n<p>However, the move has sparked debate, with some questioning whether purchasing a memecoin linked to President Trump could blur ethical lines. Recent controversy surrounding the TRUMP token intensified after reports surfaced of a<a href=\"https://www.cointrackdaily.com/trump-to-host-exclusive-dinner-for-top-trump-token-holders/\"> private dinner offered to top token holders</a>, prompting sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers. On 25 April, Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia decried the event as an apparent attempt to monetise access to the presidency, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>Freight Technologies’ strategy mirrors a broader trend among corporations diving into cryptocurrencies. Pioneered by Michael Saylor’s bitcoin-centric approach at Strategy, the practice has gained traction, with firms like Semler Scientific and Cantor following suit. In Japan, companies such as Metaplanet, which recently amassed 5,000 BTC and issued $25 million in bonds for further purchases, exemplify this growing appetite for digital assets. Smaller players, including Value Creation and Remixpoint, are also building crypto reserves, while firms like Sol Strategies and Janover are snapping up SOL tokens to offer investors exposure to the crypto market.</p>\n<p>For Freight Technologies, whose stock has endured a bruising 90% decline over the past year, the TRUMP token investment appears to be a calculated effort to revive its fortunes. The announcement triggered a remarkable 111% surge in its share price before markets closed on Friday, though after-hours trading saw a 21.6% retreat. Meanwhile, TRUMP tokens, trading at $12.7, have risen 42% over the past month, buoyed by their association with the U.S. President.</p>\n<p>The crypto space has also seen other Trump-linked investments, notably DWF Labs’ $25 million stake in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralised finance protocol backed by the Trump family. WLFI, which is preparing to launch a stablecoin pegged to U.S. Treasury bills, underscores the growing intersection of politics and digital finance.</p>\n\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 1 -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\t\n\t\t\t</article></div>",

The Coinbase Premium Index, a reliable barometer of US market sentiment, sits comfortably in positive territory at 0.042 and shows promising upward momentum.</p>\n<p>However, institutional behaviour tells a markedly different tale. ETF flow patterns have revealed a potentially troubling sequence: modest accumulation phases typically precede substantial sell-offs. This pattern manifested twice previously – initially in February, when a purchase of 8,790 ETH preceded a hefty disposal of 146,950 ETH, and subsequently in March, when acquisition of 5,890 ETH was followed by divestment of 28,950 ETH.</p>\n<p>Rather worryingly, this pattern appears to be repeating itself, with institutional investors having acquired merely 14,570 ETH in recent days. Historical precedent suggests cause for concern – previous instances triggered price plunges of 38.56% and 29.30% respectively.</p>\n<p>The funding market presents additional headwinds, with its premium languishing in negative territory at -0.6, suggesting institutional investors maintain a decidedly bearish outlook and continue to offload positions.</p>\n<p>The cryptocurrency now stands at a crucial inflection point. The robust retail buying momentum could potentially catalyse a rally, yet the conspicuous absence of institutional support, coupled with historical patterns, hints at possible downward pressure.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 1 -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\t\n\t\t\t</article></div>",

He argued that historical patterns show the digital asset tends to perform best during periods of aggressive money printing—conditions he believes are only intensifying.</p>\n\n<p>Citing rising costs tied to entitlement programs, defense spending, and growing interest payments, Hayes noted that neither political party has proposed meaningful fiscal restraint. Whether under President Biden or Trump, the deficit trajectory remains upward, he said, which further supports Bitcoin’s long-term appeal.</p>\n\n<p>According to Hayes, structural spending pressures—such as increased military budgets and mandatory payments like Social Security and Medicare—make it nearly impossible for the U.S. government to cut back without triggering serious disruption. This unsustainable path, he suggests, will lead to further devaluation of the dollar, making Bitcoin an attractive hedge for institutions and individuals alike.</p>\n\n\n<p>He also emphasized that Bitcoin’s growing status as a strategic reserve asset is now entering the institutional mainstream. With regulated ETFs now trading and an evolving perception of Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, Hayes believes the <a>digital currency</a> is transitioning from a speculative bet to a long-term macro hedge — particularly in an era of waning U.S. global dominance.</p>\n<p>Hayes added that the psychological shift among traditional investors is equally important. With the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, many asset managers now view BTC not as a volatile tech play, but as digital gold — a tool for long-term capital preservation. If this narrative continues to gain traction, he believes we could witness a snowball effect of institutional adoption, further reinforcing Bitcoin’s upward trajectory.</p><!-- CONTENT END 1 -->\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://t.me/coindoo_media\">\n        <img alt=\"telegram\" width=\"932\" height=\"236\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/themes/coinpress/images/Banner_en-US_Poppins_new.png\">\n    </a>\n</p><section>\n    <span>Author</span>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n                                <p><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-300x300.jpg 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-400x400.jpg 400w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-768x768.jpg 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-600x600.jpg 600w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n.jpg 1372w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\">                </p>\n                                            \n            </div>\n                <p>Alex is an experienced finance journalist and a cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiast.

The bullish momentum must pick up in the coming days to make that breakout possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-fibonacci-levels-suggest-key-support-zones-for-bitcoin-price\"><strong>Fibonacci Levels Suggest Key Support Zones for Bitcoin Price</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The price action at the time of writing showed signs of a correction within the larger bullish trend. <a href=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/04/15/whale-sells-1200-btc-at-loss-analyst-warns-against-premature-bullish-hopes/\">Bitcoin price</a> retraced to key Fibonacci levels, which could act as important support zones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 23.60%, 38.20%, and 50% Fibonacci retracement levels at $93,561, $92,171, and $91,047, respectively, were crucial support levels to watch. Those levels indicated where Bitcoin could find support before continuing its upward trend.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"607\" src=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-105-1024x607.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-105-1024x607.png 1024w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-105-300x178.png 300w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-105-768x455.png 768w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-105-1536x910.png 1536w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-105-150x89.png 150w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-105-696x412.png 696w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-105-1068x633.png 1068w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-105.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>Source: X</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Fibonacci extensions also showed that Bitcoin could face resistance around the $96,375 and $97,585 levels. If the price manages to hold above these key retracement levels, it could indicate that the bullish trend is intact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, a breakdown below the described levels could suggest further downward movement. In that scenario, BTC price could test lower support areas before any potential rally.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-market-sentiment-and-demand-divergence\"><strong>Market Sentiment and Demand Divergence</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amidst a week that saw the digital asset reach a new record high, there were observations indicating that the Bitcoin market <a href=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/04/15/whale-sells-1200-btc-at-loss-analyst-warns-against-premature-bullish-hopes/\">sentiment</a> was still mixed. More than 85% of Bitcoin holders were in profit, which could indicate a state of euphoria in the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could also mean that it is in the overbought zone. Therefore, a short-term pullback can take place. Furthermore, the 30-day Demand Momentum for Bitcoin remained negative. It signaled a lack of strong demand from short-term holders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to data, long-term holders were accumulating less BTC than short-term holders were distributing. This divergence suggested that the recent price gains could be driven more by traders than by long-term investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such dynamics tend to occur before the retrenchments in the market, thus raising concerns over the stability of the current Bitcoin price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the number of active addresses was on the rise. It is a positive sign for the Bitcoin market when it comes to short-term retracements.</p>\n</div><div data-td-block-uid=\"tdi_123\">\n\n<p><h4><span>Disclaimer</span></h4></p><p>The contents of this page are intended for general informational purposes and do not constitute financial, investment, or any other form of advice.

Attention pivots to alternative bills pending gubernatorial review.</p>\n<h2>Arizona Maintains Traditional Fund Strategies Post-Veto</h2>\n<p><strong>Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs</strong> vetoed <a href=\"https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/81632\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Senate Bill 1025</a>, a measure that allowed the investment of public funds in virtual currencies. <strong>Co-sponsored by Wendy Rogers and Jeff Weninger</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.azleg.gov/govlettr/57leg/1r/sb1025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this bill passed</a> the Arizona House with a narrow 31–25 vote. Governor Hobbs highlighted the state’s retirement fund’s strength and suitability for <strong>traditional investments</strong> over virtual currencies.</p>\n<p><strong>The immediate implications</strong> of the veto mean that Arizona’s public funds will not be allocated towards cryptocurrencies. Instead, the existing investment strategies will continue, excluding digital asset exposure and resisting potential volatility.</p>\n\n<blockquote>“The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments. Arizonans’ retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currency.” — <em>Katie Hobbs, Governor of Arizona</em> <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/03/arizona-governor-calls-crypto-an-untested-investment-vetoes-bitcoin-reserve-bill\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CoinDesk</a></blockquote><p><strong>Reactions to the veto</strong> came quietly, with both sponsors and crypto figures refraining from extensive commentary. The <strong>crypto community</strong> has identified Arizona’s legislation as a key indicator for broader institutional adoption. The failure of the bill marks a missed opportunity but shifts focus to other legislative propositions.</p>\n<h2>Analyzing Market Position and Expert Opinions</h2>\n<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Arizona would have been pioneering in the U.S. with a crypto reserve fund, potentially influencing state-driven requests for Bitcoin exposure.</p>\n<p>The current market data for Bitcoin shows a price of $96,044.15, with a market cap of $1.91 trillion and a 63.91% dominance, according to CoinMarketCap. The 24-hour trading volume has declined by 43.01%, and recent price changes indicate a slight decrease of 0.84% over the past 24 hours while exhibiting a longer-term increase of 15.45% over 30 days.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <a href=\"https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bitcoin-daily-chart-on-0018-UTC-on-May-4-2025file.jpeg\">\n    <img width=\"1072\" height=\"477\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201072%20477'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"bitcoin-daily-chart-657\" title=\"Arizona Governor Vetoes Bill on Crypto Investments for Public Funds 1\" data-lazy-srcset=\"//coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bitcoin-daily-chart-on-0018-UTC-on-May-4-2025file.jpeg 1072w, //coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bitcoin-daily-chart-on-0018-UTC-on-May-4-2025file-300x133.jpeg 300w, //coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bitcoin-daily-chart-on-0018-UTC-on-May-4-2025file-1024x456.jpeg 1024w, //coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bitcoin-daily-chart-on-0018-UTC-on-May-4-2025file-768x342.jpeg 768w, //coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bitcoin-daily-chart-on-0018-UTC-on-May-4-2025file-24x11.jpeg 24w, //coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bitcoin-daily-chart-on-0018-UTC-on-May-4-2025file-36x16.jpeg 36w, //coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bitcoin-daily-chart-on-0018-UTC-on-May-4-2025file-48x21.jpeg 48w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px\" data-lazy-src=\"//coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bitcoin-daily-chart-on-0018-UTC-on-May-4-2025file.jpeg\">\n  </a>\n  <figcaption>Bitcoin(BTC), daily chart, screenshot on CoinMarketCap at 00:18 UTC on May 4, 2025. <em>Source: <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CoinMarketCap</a></em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p><strong>Coincu research insights suggest</strong> that while the veto maintains the status quo, the alternative bills could drive future policy.

The digital asset has since retraced and is trading for $0.197 at time of writing, a 64.3% increase during the last 24 hours.</p>\n<p>The project’s whitepaper <a href=\"https://static.stakestone.io/whitepaper.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">says</a> it aims to solve the issue of liquidity fragmentation within the digital assets industry.</p>\n<p><em> “The fragmentation of liquidity across different chains and protocols across the blockchain ecosystem results in billions of dollars in trapped capital and missed yield opportunities, reducing value creation and ecosystem growth.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Users face complex workflows and high costs when moving assets between chains, while protocols struggle to maintain deep liquidity pools.</em></p>\n<p><em>StakeStone serves as a foundational infrastructure layer that enables efficient liquidity distribution across the entire blockchain ecosystem. By providing a standardized framework for cross-chain liquidity management, StakeStone empowers both established and emerging networks to access and deploy capital efficiently.” </em></p>\n<p>STO was also a part of Binance Alpha, a wallet feature that started in December 2024.

    "text": "Here's your top-notch crypto rundown: South Korea's financial regulators are bringing the heat, making life super tough for crypto exchanges and non-profits starting in June - no more shenanigans. Justin Sun gets into it with OKX over a mysterious freeze notice that'll have you wondering what happened to the chill vibes. And get ready for a serious reboot, folks! Korea's election might shake things up, changing market strategies and laws.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ethereum is looking bullish after forming a divergence that could mean big price growth - some analysts predict it'll hit $2,500. XRP's on the move too, with signals suggesting a massive surge in store. Freight Technologies takes a major bet on Trump's latest meme token, sparking debate over ethics and politics.<br /><br />Ethereum is at an interesting crossroads: will retail enthusiasm be enough to overcome institutional selling pressure? Arthur Hayes thinks Bitcoin could hit $1 million soon due to expanding US government debt. And Bitcoin tests the $96.5k level with increasing Open Interest and declining exchange reserves - this might just be a breakout to $100k.<br /><br />Major exchanges are moving in on the US market thanks to Trump's crypto-friendly policies, while Senator Cynthia Lummis throws her weight behind his Bitcoin reserve plan. Bitcoin is near critical levels, but miners' selling pressure will test its strength. Don't forget that AZ Governor Katie Hobbs vetoes a bill allowing public funds to invest in cryptocurrencies due to concerns over virtual currencies.",
