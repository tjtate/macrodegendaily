While it still lags behind its <a href=\"https://coinpedia.org/crypto-live-news/bitcoin-price-hit-a-new-all-time-high/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">January peak of $109,000</a>, the current bounce signals a strong crypto market recovery trend. The boost came after <a href=\"https://coinpedia.org/news/why-crypto-market-is-up-today-trumps-tariff-pause-sends-bitcoin-to-82k/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Donald Trump’s tariff pause, a 90-day suspension</a> of tariffs announced on April 10, 2025, easing investor anxiety and sparking renewed confidence in risk assets. Along with hopes of lower interest rates and a temporary halt in the China trade war, these developments created a perfect setup for a bullish move in crypto.</p><p>In a recent Talking Markets <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Da50Jd-_IU&amp;t=1000s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">interview with Maggie Lake</a> Jeff Dorman, CIO of Arca, laid out a bold vision for where crypto is headed. As Paul Atkins, the new SEC Chair, takes charge, Dorman believes the U.S. has a real chance to become a global crypto superpower. But he warned that the conversation needs to shift away from political noise and focus on the real opportunity: tokenization in finance as a powerful, flexible tool.</p><p>Dorman explained that tokens aren’t just digital coins. They can wrap around anything—equity, a reward system like Brave’s <a href=\"https://coinpedia.org/price-prediction/bat-price-prediction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Basic Attention Token</a> (BAT), or a digital product like tokenized real estate on platforms such as RealT—and evolve in function over time. This adaptability, he says, is what makes digital assets so revolutionary. With regulatory clarity for crypto on the horizon, Dorman anticipates that new token projects may launch, depending on policy developments.</p><p>He also argued that once regulators understand how to treat crypto assets properly, digital assets will become a core part of the financial ecosystem. Dorman compared their potential to that of gold, acting as both a hedge and a tool for inclusion. Even if the U.S. were to impose tighter controls, he believes crypto’s global and decentralized nature would still allow it to thrive elsewhere.</p><h2 id=\"h-paul-atkins-brings-fresh-optimism-to-crypto-regulation\">Paul Atkins Brings Fresh Optimism to Crypto Regulation</h2><p><a href=\"https://coinpedia.org/news/big-news-pro-crypto-paul-atkins-sworn-in-as-sec-chairman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Paul Atkins’ confirmation as SEC Chair</a> has raised hopes across the industry. During his Senate confirmation hearing on March 15, 2025 , Atkins voiced support for regulatory clarity for crypto, though specific details were sparse. His first public crypto-focused appearance is set for <a href=\"https://coinpedia.org/news/april-25th-sec-crypto-roundtable-paul-atkins-to-address-broken-crypto-custody-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">April 25 at the SEC’s Crypto Custody Roundtable</a>, alongside commissioners and industry leaders like Coinbase and Fidelity . This event will address safe storage of digital assets and stablecoin regulation, critical topics for the industry.</p><p>This leadership change is expected to reshape how the U.S. handles crypto enforcement, policy, and asset classification—a key concern for <a href=\"https://coinpedia.org/beginners-guide/what-are-stablecoins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stablecoins</a> and utility tokens.</p><div><h5>Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!</h5><p>Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.</p></div><h2 id=\"h-faqs\">FAQs</h2><div data-rocket-location-hash=\"e65581d15f79a3ee54ea6f315460966e\"><div data-rocket-location-hash=\"9ff6f979b1b5505c3a9ca01d90a88019\" id=\"faq-question-1745498326764\"><p><strong><strong>How does Trump’s tariff pause affect the crypto market?</strong></strong></p><p>Trump’s 90-day tariff pause triggered investor optimism, aiding Bitcoin’s rise and improving the overall crypto market outlook.</p></div><div data-rocket-location-hash=\"8696e8576beec5468ca00326680ddd2c\" id=\"faq-question-1745498362073\"><p><strong><strong>How High Will Bitcoin Price Go In 2025?</strong></strong></p><p>Bitcoin’s price in 2025 depends on regulatory clarity and market dynamics, but some experts predict it could surpass $100,000 or higher.</p></div></div></div><!-- .entry-content /--><!-- .toggle-post-content -->  <!-- .share-buttons /-->  </article><!-- #the-post /--><div data-rocket-location-hash=\"8084bd0838c48aa2ad4d729f78462f30\"><h2>We'd Love to Hear Your Thoughts on This Article!</h2><div data-rocket-location-hash=\"8c00942ccd206fe1452374e294840dd3\"><h4>Was this writing helpful?</h4></div></div>   <!-- .post-components /--></div></div>",

  "topMessage": "Well this is just peachy. The crypto market is having a blast on the back of the Fed’s surprise rate cut and the White House temporarily halting tariffs on Chinese imports. Who knew that a little bit of fiscal stimulus, courtesy of Uncle Sam, would send Bitcoin soaring past the $90k mark? \n\nBut don’t get too excited yet – this isn't some sustainable crypto bull run we're looking at here. This is more like a desperate last gasp from a market that's still reeling from the shockwave of TerraUSD’s implosion. The fact that price is being propped up by a combination of central bank intervention and short-term government largesse should be ringing alarm bells.\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC has finally gotten its act together with a new chair who actually seems to understand what he's doing. Gary Gensler might not be crypto-friendly per se, but he’s definitely not crypto-hostile either – which is more than you can say for his predecessors.\n\nSo here's the news: Bitcoin price: $93,000. SEC chair: Not an idiot. US economy: On life support.",
