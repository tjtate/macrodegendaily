The concern is especially pronounced following recent policy signals from Washington. Since President Trump’s return to office, the U.S. has moved quickly to craft a regulatory framework for the sector, including efforts to establish rules for stablecoins tied to the dollar.</p>\n\n<p>Rome’s warning comes amid a sharp rise in crypto asset prices, a trend attributed in part to America’s friendlier stance toward the industry. While stablecoins have generally held their value, the broader crypto space remains unpredictable and prone to rapid swings.</p>\n\n\n<p>Officials from the European Central Bank share the anxiety. Top figures from France and Finland have both cautioned against the normalization of crypto assets, with Finland’s Olli Rehn stating plainly that he views the U.S. direction as a cause for concern.</p>\n<p>Italy’s central bank also highlighted a more specific risk tied to stablecoins: many of them rely on short-term U.S. government bonds to maintain their peg. A failure by a major issuer could spark a liquidation of those assets, potentially shaking the Treasury market and creating ripple effects across the global financial system.</p><!-- CONTENT END 1 -->\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://t.me/coindoo_media\">\n        <img alt=\"telegram\" width=\"932\" height=\"236\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/themes/coinpress/images/Banner_en-US_Poppins_new.png\">\n    </a>\n</p><section>\n    <span>Author</span>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n                                <p><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-300x300.jpg 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-400x400.jpg 400w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-768x768.jpg 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-600x600.jpg 600w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n.jpg 1372w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\">                </p>\n                                            \n            </div>\n                <p>Alex is an experienced finance journalist and a cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiast.

If so, why is a blockchain necessary for this processing? (What is the rationale for this choice?</em><br>\n<em>What are the alternatives?)</em></p>\n<p><em>iii. What type of blockchain should be used? (Is a private blockchain sufficient? Can a permissioned</em><br>\n<em>blockchain be used? Is a ‘zero-knowledge’ architecture possible?)</em></p>\n<p><em>iv. What technical and organizational measures are used? (Will personal data be stored on or offchain? Are any privacy-enhancing technologies being used – if not, why?)”</em></p>\n<p>The EDPB says that blockchains are not an exception to GDPR laws, and should take into account how they process certain data. To comply with GDPR, the regulator says blockchains may need to be completely deleted if the deletion of GDPR-relevant data isn’t already taken into account to the network’s original creation.</p>\n<p><em>“Personal data must be erased once the purposes of the processing has been achieved and any</em><br>\n<em>regulatory periods for retention have expired in order to conform to the principle of storage</em><br>\n<em>limitation. </em></p>\n<p><em>Data deletion at the individual level in a blockchain can be challenging and requires ad-hoc</em><br>\n<em>engineered architectures.

The firm currently holds over 553,555 BTC, by far the largest stash among public entities. Other major players, including Twenty One Capital, have also entered the arena, fueling speculation that institutional adoption is accelerating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, Back’s $200 trillion market cap estimate represents a staggering leap from Bitcoin’s current valuation, which hovers around $1.3 trillion as of April 2025. Achieving this target would mean Bitcoin becomes the most valuable financial asset in history, surpassing global real estate, equities, and even sovereign debt markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, critics have viewed such projections as overly optimistic, but Back insisted that the rate at which Bitcoin has outpaced both inflation and interest rates is a sign of its long-term viability. <em>“The macro environment favors hard assets</em>,” he noted, pointing to the weakening trust in fiat currencies and growing inflationary pressures worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding fuel to the bullish sentiment, investment firm ARK Invest recently <a href=\"https://zycrypto.com/cathie-woods-ark-invest-raises-bullish-bitcoin-forecast-to-2-4-million-by-2030/\">revised</a> its 2030 forecast, setting Bitcoin’s price targets between $500,000 and $2.4 million, depending on adoption rates by institutions and sovereign wealth funds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At press time, BTC was trading at $95,196, reflecting a 0.04% surge in the past 24 hours.</p>\n        </div></div>",

After weeks of struggling below key levels, Ethereum now appears to have completed a market structure break, with a technical analyst pointing to $1,500 as the zone where </span><a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-network-activity-spikes-as-price-rallies-bullish-reversal-coming/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span>buyers have regained control</span></a><span>, and a break above $4,000.</span></p>\n<h2>Ethereum Structure Break And The $1,500 Turnaround Point</h2>\n<p><span>Crypto analyst SwallowAcademy, in </span><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSDT.P/0VytxaT9-Ethereum-ETH-Buyers-Forming-Market-Structure-Break/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>a recent technical breakdown </span></a><span>of Ethereum’s weekly candlestick chart, noted that buyers have successfully initiated a clean market structure break just above the $1,500 zone. Earlier this month, Ethereum briefly</span><a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-tanks-1550/\" target=\"_blank\"><span> dropped as low as $1,415,</span></a><span> a level that initially </span><a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-to-crash-to-1000-1500/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>appeared to signal further downside. </span></a><span>However, what followed was a sharp reaction from bullish traders </span><a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-whales-just-accumulated-640k-eth-is-a-bigger-rally-coming/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>who aggressively accumulated</span></a><span> during that dip, effectively neutralizing the intense selling pressure that had driven the price down.</span></p>\n\n\n<p><span>This influx of buyer interest not only prevented a deeper breakdown but also laid the groundwork for a notable structural shift in market behavior. Since then, Ethereum’s price has exhibited signs of strength, consistently finding support during minor retracements </span><a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-attempts-first-major-horizontal-reclaim-in-months-can-bulls-hold-the-line/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>around the $1,500 region.</span></a><span> This repeated defense of support led to the formation of a market structure break, which is a technical formation that often signals a transition from bearish to bullish price action.</span></p><div><div id=\"placement_607465_0\"><p><img src=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/text-banner-logo-bitstarz.png\" data-pin-no-hover=\"true\"></p><p>BitStarz Player Lands $2,459,124 Record Win!

This is a notable change, especially as the price is now climbing toward the $1,900 resistance region —a range that also aligns with the 50-week moving average and serves as a gateway to further upside.

A man in business always gives value in return for his revenue, and thus performs a useful function.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>— Andrew Carnegie</p>\n</blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about the competitive threat posed by newly formed Federal Steel, Andrew Carnegie scoffed that its real specialty was “manufacturing stock certificates,” not steel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That dismissive comment was emblematic of the 1890s boom in industrial “trust” stocks, most of which Carnegie thought had little to do with business and everything to do with speculation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were exceptions — the big monopolistic trusts formed in things like oil, sugar and tobacco unsurprisingly turned out to be good investments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there were also trusts formed in things like rope, wallpaper and coffins that were essentially stock-promotion schemes that did not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1893 collapse of the National Cordage Company — the “Rope Trust” — even triggered a widespread financial panic that brought down many other trusts that were similarly in the business of “manufacturing stock certificates.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That outcome might be a cautionary tale for crypto, an industry still best known for manufacturing tokens (not value).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vast majority of those tokens don’t do anything — and those that do mostly just represent different ways of trading useless tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The crypto market remains highly self-referential like that, but the hope has always been that this would change in time: Build a new financial system and the assets and investors will come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If so, it feels like they should be arriving any time now — the technology is now good enough, blockspace is cheap and plentiful enough, and the SEC is in remission.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are hopeful signs that it might be happening.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a notable <a href=\"https://app.rwa.xyz/treasuries\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">boomlet</a> of real-world assets moving onchain, for example — mostly thanks to the success of BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL (a product that is in many ways genuinely superior to its off-chain equivalents).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stablecoin assets are also <a href=\"https://defillama.com/stablecoins\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">trending higher</a> and may only be getting started: Mastercard’s <a href=\"https://x.com/MastercardNews/status/1916896208187986114?t=7DKVU8CYZHfPf5bbyvVSvQ&amp;s=19\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">announcement</a> this morning that it’ll be facilitating payments with stablecoins may be the thing that finally brings crypto to the non-crypto masses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From levels of $240 billion now, a recent <a href=\"https://x.com/jerallaire/status/1915466281479753824\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">report</a> from Citi predicts that stablecoin assets under management will surge to as much as $3.5 trillion by 2030.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Note: I did the math and found out that 2030 is <em>four and a half years away. </em>Shocking, I know, but true.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are anything like 3.5 trillion tokenized dollars onchain, investable assets will follow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have recently, for example, bought two <a href=\"https://collectorcrypt.com/marketplace/cards\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">Pokémon cards</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.baxus.co/?sortBy=priority%3Adesc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">bottle of whiskey</a> onchain, simply because I had some spare dollars onchain and crypto makes it very easy to buy Pokémon cards and bottles of whiskey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So easy that I now consider both those things investable assets — not having to either take delivery or store collectibles like that is a game changer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing in cards and bottles is also more fun than making 4% in BUIDL or losing 100% in memecoins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, there will soon be more options for crypto investors to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyle Samani even believes there will be <em>all</em> the options: “Virtually all assets will trade on inherently global and permissionless systems like Solana,” he predicted in a <a href=\"https://multicoin.capital/2025/01/22/the-solana-thesis-internet-capital-markets/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">recent report</a> on the future of crypto capital markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If so, that will include stocks and bonds, of course, but also — and more intriguingly — all-new kinds of crypto-native assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s still kind of hard to imagine what these will look like beyond the current offering of blockchain and DeFi tokens — which are almost all self-referentially leveraged to the trading of crypto.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now that blockspace is so cheap and plentiful, people are trying new things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/timedotfun?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">Time.fun</a>, for example, is an experiment in tokenizing people’s time; <a href=\"https://zora.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">Zora</a> is an experiment in using “content coins” to surface and prioritize information; TRUMP, a “celebrity coin,” is an experiment in tokenizing emoluments; <a href=\"https://www.story.foundation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">Story Protocol</a> is an experiment in programable, tokenized IP; <a href=\"https://x.com/believeapp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">Believe App</a> is an experiment that turns X posts into memecoins (or “idea coins”) that offer to fund the business ideas they loosely represent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like most experiments, these will probably fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if crypto capital markets keep throwing spaghetti on the wall like this, some new and interesting things should eventually stick.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, they might not all be crypto things, either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wall Street has been doing less and less experimenting as of late: Tomasz Tunguz <a href=\"https://tomtunguz.com/ipo-size-2024/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">notes</a> that only two companies with less than $100 million of revenue have IPO’d in the US since 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That failure to offer investors new things to invest in is at least partly because the IPO process has gotten so expensive: Tunguz estimates that it can cost a $100 million revenue company as much as $26 million to list on a US stock exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is a prohibitively expensive way to raise capital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raising capital in crypto, by contrast, is almost infinitely cheaper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, literally so: The token that Zora issued is “just for fun,” which means Zora has raised equity capital without having to sell equity — a weird trick that’s only possible in crypto.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That has not worked out very well for crypto investors so far.&nbsp; For most investors in most crypto tokens, returns have been pretty terrible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lots of people have gotten rich in crypto, of course, but not by creating or investing in useful things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, it’s mostly been from the manufacturing of tokens.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrew Carnegie would be unimpressed — businesses, he believed, should succeed by giving “value in return for the revenue” and not just offering new things to speculate on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he might be sympathetic to crypto markets because stock markets weren’t very serious in his time, either — not until he created the first modern stock by merging his Carnegie Steel Company into US Steel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>US Steel was the product of the kind of financial engineering Carnegie derided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it was also the first billion-dollar corporation, the first corporation to publish modern financial statements, and arguably the first to have truly public ownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto capital markets are still in their stage of manufacturing tokens.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But their US-Steel moment may — finally — be near.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get the news in your inbox.

Once acknowledged by the SEC, the application will be published in the Federal Register, tying the regulator to a decision deadline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>21Shares’ proposed Dogecoin ETF will operate as a passive investment product, with shares created and redeemed in blocks of 10,000 through authorized participants using cash transactions only. As per the filing, the trust will not employ leverage or derivatives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trading of ETF shares will be subject to Nasdaq’s surveillance procedures and trading rules. In supporting the proposal, Nasdaq claimed that its membership in the Intermarket Surveillance Group (ISG) provides strong surveillance-sharing agreements, enabling it to detect and prevent potential manipulation in the underlying Dogecoin market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Switzerland-based crypto asset manager filed its S-1 form on April 9, it also <a href=\"https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-secures-big-institutional-nod-as-21shares-files-for-spot-doge-etf-after-exclusive-partnership-with-house-of-doge/\">announced </a>an “exclusive” partnership with the House of Doge, which will help market the fund.</p><p><span>Advertisement</span><a href=\"https://zycryp.to/GoogleNews\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open('https://zycryp.to/GoogleNews', '_blank', 'noopener'); return false;\"><img width=\"500\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Follow-ZyCrypto-On-Google-News-1.png\" alt=\"Follow ZyCrypto On Google News\"></a>\n\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DOGE is currently the 8th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap at $26.6 billion, CoinGecko data shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a DOGE ETF is approved, it would become the first ETF to track a meme coin, a cryptocurrency that was initially created as a joke.

The SEC just put off making decisions on Ethereum and Doge ETFs until mid-June while dozens of altcoin funds get filed by Wall Street firms, so let's all take a deep breath and calm down. But seriously though, if you think institutional investors are coming for your precious cryptos, better make sure you got some stablecoins on hand.<br /><br />Oh and the US Senate will reportedly vote on that stablecoin regulation bill before Memorial Day which means we're probably gonna see some more volatility. It's like the whole crypto world is one big regulatory roulette game right now.<br /><br />Chainlink shows signs of life and Fidelity thinks Bitcoin is getting undervalued, so you know what that means - it's time to buy more Dogecoin because logic!<br /><br />Trump Media is launching a utility token to power Truth Social and Truth+ services which just means more tokens for everyone!<br /><br />Italy's central bank is worried about global financial stability because the US government is friendly towards cryptos, but hey, someone has to be the bad guy.<br /><br />The EU might kill public blockchains with their new data protection guidelines, so let's all say goodbye to blockchain while we still can. <br /><br />Get more details on the above... below!",
