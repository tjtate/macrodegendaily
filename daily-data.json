      "content": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div data-td-block-uid=\"tdi_122\">\n<p>BRETT coin delivered an impressive weekly performance, earning a spot as the top gainer in the top 10 meme coin list. Meme coins have performed well as the markets recovered this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But just how impressive were BRETT gains? It turns out that its weekly gains outshone even the top-ranking coins by marketcap, including <a href=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/04/20/dogecoin-prices-big-move-ahead-heres-all-you-need-to-know/\">Dogecoin</a> and Shiba Inu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BRETT managed to pull off an 89% plus upside in the last 7 days. The closest meme coin to BRETT’s impressive returns was the Official TRUMP meme coin. It was up about 83.3% during the same period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For context, Dogecoin pulled off a 15.8% weekly upside, while Shiba Inu rallied by 18.5%. This confirms that BRETT and the other newer but mainstream entries to the market have been receiving more attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-is-a-retracement-on-the-cards-as-brett-coin-enters-overbought-territory\"><strong>Is a Retracement on the Cards as BRETT Coin Enters Overbought Territory?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BRETT price action was even more impressive considering how much it has recovered from its lowest price point in April. For context, BRETT coin’s price traded as low as $0.026. And it recently rallied as high as $0.071 in the last 24 hours, marking a 200% gain.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"474\" src=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-994-1024x474.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-994-1024x474.png 1024w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-994-300x139.png 300w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-994-768x356.png 768w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-994-150x69.png 150w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-994-696x322.png 696w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-994-1068x494.png 1068w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-994.png 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>BRETT price action/ source: TradingView</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The impressive bullish performance put BRETT deep in overbought territory. This that it was likely to start experiencing sell pressure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, that may have already been in play at the time of observation considering that price pulled back to a $0.068 press time price tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chances of a retracement in the short term will heavily depend on whether the market sentiment will cool down further. So far it has shown some resilience, indicating that the downside could be limited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BRETT coin was also still heavily discounted, by roughly 72% from its December peak. As such, holders may have an incentive to HODL in anticipation of more recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, BRETT’s latest performance may potentially attract more investment. This is because investors have been keeping an eye on the best performing coins in the recovery phase to identify the most promising ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-evaluating-the-state-of-demand-on-the-spot-and-derivatives-segment\"><strong>Evaluating the State of Demand on the Spot and Derivatives Segment</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The expectations of profit-taking were not necessarily misplaced. The meme coin experienced a surge in spot outflows in the last 24 hours. They amounted to about $698 million. In the grand scheme of things. that was still relatively low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Derivatives volumes were up by 54.84% in the last 24 hours to $201.14 million. Meanwhile, open interest was up 4.91% during the same period to around $67.53 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most noteworthy aspects of BRETT derivatives was that in the last 24 hours, its funding rates surged to a new 2025 high. The highest levels observed since early December, but this could also expose BRETT to heavy liquidations if price pivots.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-995-1024x248.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-995-1024x248.png 1024w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-995-300x73.png 300w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-995-768x186.png 768w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-995-150x36.png 150w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-995-696x169.png 696w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-995-1068x259.png 1068w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-995.png 1331w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>BRETT funding rates/ source: Coinglass</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-brett-coin-price-prediction\"><strong>BRETT Coin Price Prediction</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With respect to BRETT price predictions, the recent demand surge could usher in heavy liquidity in the coming months. The meme coin’s recovery so far underscores strong demand resurgence. It could possibly push as high as $0.090 in the short term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Past performance especially in 2024 revealed solid recovery in BRETT’s price action. If this remains the case, then the meme coin could potentially retest its previous high in the coming months. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would require a 262% upside. It also underscores the <a href=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/04/25/best-meme-coins-to-buy-for-10x-gains-in-the-new-bull-rally/\">meme coin’s status</a> as one to keep an eye out for as the market continues on its recovery path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the total meme coin marketcap was up 4.9% in the last 24 hours, pushing to $61.52 billion. The recovery was also enough confirmation that the meme coin segment was still heavily active despite concerns that investors may favor utility coins.</p>\n</div><div data-td-block-uid=\"tdi_123\">\n\n<p><h4><span>Disclaimer</span></h4></p><p>The contents of this page are intended for general informational purposes and do not constitute financial, investment, or any other form of advice.

If passed, this legislative action could enable Arizona’s treasury and state retirement system to allocate up to 10% of funds into Bitcoin and other digital assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Should the bills succeed, they may transform Arizona into a pioneer state in public-sector digital asset policy.</strong> The legislation also outlines methods for investing through state-registered crypto products and securing returns via qualified custodians. The bills’ adoption would mark a significant step in legitimizing public investments in cryptocurrencies at a state level.</p>\n\n<blockquote>However, the potential for a gubernatorial veto remains high due to ongoing budgetary disputes. Governor Katie Hobbs has threatened to veto all legislative bills, including those related to Bitcoin, due to disagreements over disability funding. This uncertainty has sparked lively discussions within the crypto community.

See how Ethereum, Solana, Pepe, and Cold Wallet are transforming crypto privacy and showing huge gains.</p><p><span>Choosing the top cryptos to buy now in 2025 goes beyond chasing trends. It involves understanding where real value, usage, and demand meet at the right time. As users grow smarter and look for real solutions, a few projects are getting noticed for what they deliver rather than what they claim. Whether it’s addressing privacy gaps, scaling transaction speeds, attracting big institutional attention, or rallying massive communities, these four cryptos are presenting solid cases.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Cold <a>Wallet</a> is making a major mark by redefining transaction privacy and user control. Ethereum maintains its lead as the smart contract leader with important upgrades on the way. Solana is gaining fresh momentum with strong <a>DEX</a> performance and fast price increases. Pepe, once dismissed as a simple meme, is now driving real volume and building its own ecosystem. Let’s look at why these are the top cryptos to buy now.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><b>Cold Wallet: Real Privacy Made Simple</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>Cold Wallet fixes a huge gap that most wallet providers still overlook: privacy. It brings the convenience of a hot wallet while offering the protection of <a>cold storage</a>. Users can engage with <a>DeFi</a>, manage portfolios, and send assets without exposing IP addresses, wallet history, or personal information. It uses built-in zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to safeguard every interaction,&nbsp; from checking balances to sending private transactions,&nbsp; without revealing sensitive data. The goal is a fully private experience, yet simple enough for anyone to use.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://coldwallet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011919.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1193\" height=\"149\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011919.jpg 1193w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011919-300x37.jpg 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011919-800x100.jpg 800w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011919-768x96.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1193px) 100vw, 1193px\"></a></p>\n<p>The $CWT unit, now available in presale, supports access to features, voting rights, and community participation rewards. Anonymous <a>dApp</a> access, private asset tracking, and stealth addresses are already part of the 2025 roadmap. Support for mobile and browser platforms is on the way, along with listings on major <a>CEX</a> and DEX platforms by late 2025. <a href=\"https://coldwallet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cold Wallet</a> is creating serious tools for real privacy in digital finance. As concerns around <a>on-chain</a> tracking and surveillance grow, Cold Wallet answers those worries. For anyone serious about privacy, Cold Wallet stands out as one of the top cryptos to buy now.</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><b>Ethereum: Holding Its Position with Key Upgrades</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Ethereum doesn’t need a comeback story,&nbsp; it never left the lead. As of now, ETH trades at $1,589, remaining the most used and built-on smart contract platform across DeFi. Its coming Pectra upgrade will raise <a>staking</a> limits from 32 to 2048 ETH, introduce partial withdrawals, and automate compounding, making staking easier and more rewarding. These updates will strengthen network operations and validator earnings.</span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011921.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011921.jpg 600w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011921-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></p>\n<p><span>In March 2025, Ethereum was named in a U.S. government crypto reserve plan under the Trump administration, confirming its high trust level. These developments and Ethereum’s unmatched role in decentralized applications highlight why it belongs among the top cryptos to buy now, especially for those seeking reliable, long-term platforms supporting <a>Web3</a>’s backbone.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><b>Solana: Speed and Growth at the Forefront</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Solana is enjoying a sharp resurgence. As of mid-April 2025, it’s priced at $139.70, marking a 14% gain over the past week. It leads DEX activity again, boasting over $7 billion in total value locked. The network’s fast transaction speeds make it perfect for apps needing high throughput without the delays seen elsewhere. Proof-of-history technology also brings a new efficiency angle that’s different from Ethereum or Layer-2 solutions.</span></p>\n<p><span>Technical indicators show that a breakout to $156.28 could happen soon if resistance points are cleared. Solana is also riding the wave of wider market positivity and strong development work. The question isn’t about Solana’s survival anymore; it’s about how much it can gain during this bullish cycle. Considering these strengths, Solana remains firmly placed among the top cryptos to buy now.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><b>Pepe: Meme Status with Real Market Impact</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Pepe Coin is rewriting the rules of meme coins. Trading around $0.00000714, it has built a <a>market cap</a> topping $3 billion, with nearly $300 million moving daily. Analysts expect prices to climb toward $0.00002473 soon, and even $0.00003440 by May, indicating strong upside momentum. Pepe’s base of holders is key; about 17% have never sold their PEPE units.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://coldwallet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011926.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011926.jpg 1200w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011926-300x169.jpg 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011926-711x400.jpg 711w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011926-768x432.jpg 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011926-915x515.jpg 915w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p>\n<p><span>The excitement around Pepe is growing with projects like Mind of Pepe ($MIND), an AI venture linked to the Pepe community, raising over $7.6 million in presale. Offering high APYs of up to 295% and major interest, this expansion strengthens the entire Pepe movement. While it doesn’t stick to traditional measures, Pepe’s cultural relevance and market energy highlight it as one of the top cryptos to buy now.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Summing Up!</b></h2>\n<p><span>Finding the top cryptos to buy now means looking deeper than flashy headlines. It demands attention to real user needs and actual solutions. Cold Wallet is answering growing privacy concerns with strong zero-knowledge technology and a no-tracking design, setting a new privacy standard in crypto.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://coldwallet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011924.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1193\" height=\"149\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011924.jpg 1193w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011924-300x37.jpg 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011924-800x100.jpg 800w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-011924-768x96.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1193px) 100vw, 1193px\"></a></p>\n<p>Ethereum continues to push boundaries with important upgrades like Pectra, keeping it essential for validators and developers building on smart contract infrastructure. Solana is showing that transaction speed and active use are still very much in demand, pushing its price and standing higher in 2025. Meanwhile, Pepe proves that community-driven projects with cultural momentum can achieve serious success. All four present strong reasons why they are considered <a href=\"https://coldwallet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">top cryptos to buy now</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span><em><strong>This publication is sponsored.

With its presale total surging past $218.5 million, an impressive 2,380% return for early buyers, and powerful new initiatives like Buyer Battles and an aggressive price rollback, BlockDAG isn’t just part of the conversation about 2025’s top crypto coin; it is leading it.</p>\n<h3>Avalanche Price Jumps as ETF Filing Fuels Growing Optimism</h3>\n\n<p>Avalanche (AVAX) is enjoying a powerful rally, fueled by news that VanEck has filed for an AVAX ETF. This bold move has reignited excitement around Avalanche’s potential, giving it a path toward broader institutional adoption. The ETF filing mirrors what happened with Bitcoin ETFs, which famously triggered major price surges. Following the announcement, AVAX’s price jumped over 16%, according to Coinfomania, and momentum indicators are signaling the possibility of even more gains.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blockdag.network/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-buy-21000.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-buy-21000.png 1600w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-buy-21000-300x38.png 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-buy-21000-800x100.png 800w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-buy-21000-768x96.png 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-buy-21000-1536x192.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p>\n<p>The ETF angle could give Avalanche a lasting foothold beyond <a>DeFi</a>, offering exposure to a wider range of market participants. Analysts are optimistic, eyeing a possible retest of the $30 price level if current market conditions remain supportive.</p>\n<h3>TRX Remains Resilient With $70 Billion USDT Milestone</h3>\n<p>While Avalanche grabs headlines, Tron (TRX) continues to quietly dominate stablecoin transactions. According to 99Bitcoins, Tron has now facilitated more than $70 billion worth of USDT settlements, putting it among the most critical blockchains for stablecoin activity today. This sustained success reflects the strong strategic leadership from Justin Sun, who has kept Tron laser-focused on utility and transaction efficiency.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/tron-trx-129499.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1065\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/tron-trx-129499.png 1600w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/tron-trx-129499-300x200.png 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/tron-trx-129499-601x400.png 601w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/tron-trx-129499-768x511.png 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/tron-trx-129499-1536x1022.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></p>\n<p>TRX’s price is hovering near a critical resistance level, and some analysts believe a breakout could be on the horizon if momentum carries through May. Tron’s ability to deliver fast, affordable transactions has kept it highly attractive to developers and users, even amid a fiercely competitive <a>blockchain</a> landscape. However, when it comes to projects offering a truly explosive upside in returns, many in the crypto community are now looking toward BlockDAG.</p>\n<h3>BlockDAG’s $218.5M Presale, 2,380% <a>ROI</a>, Strategic Rollback, and Buyer Battles Dominate 2025 Crypto Picks</h3>\n<p>BlockDAG is not just riding a wave of interest, it is creating one. Surpassing $218.5 million in presale funding and confirming a 2,380% ROI for early buyers, BlockDAG has become a standout story in crypto’s 2025 buildup. Now, with two major catalysts, a limited-time Price Rollback and the innovative Buyer Battles competition, BlockDAG’s momentum is reaching new heights.</p>\n<p>The Price Rollback slashed Batch 27 pricing from $0.0248 back down to just $0.0025. This unexpected shift has reopened early-stage pricing, offering a final golden opportunity for buyers before the presale moves into its last stages. It’s a bold strategy that rewards swift action and adds a new surge of energy to BlockDAG’s growth.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Buyer Battles has introduced a fresh competitive twist. Every day, 25 million BDAG coins are set aside for allocation, but if they aren’t all sold, the day’s top buyer wins the remaining balance. This gamified mechanic has turned the presale into an exciting daily contest, sparking more engagement and driving daily sales volumes higher. The results are already clear: BlockDAG’s community is not just growing, it’s becoming fiercely active.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blockdag.network/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-129200.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-129200.png 1600w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-129200-300x169.png 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-129200-711x400.png 711w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-129200-768x432.png 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-129200-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-129200-915x515.png 915w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p>\n<p>Beyond the presale, BlockDAG’s technology is proving it can deliver. Its Beta Testnet is already live, handling over 800 transactions per second. The network’s hybrid Proof-of-Work and DAG model promises decentralization with major scalability, a balance that many blockchains struggle to achieve. Security audits by Halborn and CertiK, two of the top firms in crypto, further validate the project’s strength.</p>\n<p>BlockDAG is also prioritizing accessibility like no other. The <a href=\"https://blockdag.network/product/blockdagx1\" rel=\"nofollow\">X1 Miner app</a> allows users to mine BDAG coins straight from their smartphones, eliminating the usual barriers to mining entry. On the educational side, the BlockDAG Academy initiative is expanding fast, offering new users the resources they need to understand and participate in the ecosystem. With live meetups already held in places like Panama and Dubai, as well as constant digital engagement, BlockDAG’s community is growing globally, both online and in real life.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>Avalanche is making strides with the ETF buzz. Tron continues to show staying power by dominating stablecoin transactions. But BlockDAG is offering something fundamentally different: massive potential returns, strategic pricing, cutting-edge competition features, and a rapidly growing community. Its $218.5 million presale, 2,380% ROI for early supporters, limited-time $0.0025 rollback, and innovative Buyer Battles are setting it apart from the pack.</p>\n<p>For those scanning the horizon for 2025’s <a href=\"https://purchase.blockdag.network/\" rel=\"nofollow\">top crypto coin</a>, BlockDAG is not just a contender, it is setting the pace. Right now, no other project matches the explosive upside and dynamic engagement that BlockDAG is delivering.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blockdag.network/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-0004.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1193\" height=\"149\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-0004.png 1193w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-0004-300x37.png 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-0004-800x100.png 800w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/blockdag-0004-768x96.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1193px) 100vw, 1193px\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Join BlockDAG Presale Now:</strong></p>\n<p>Presale: <a href=\"https://purchase.blockdag.network/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://purchase.blockdag.network</a></p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://blockdag.network/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blockdag.network</a></p>\n<p>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial</a></p>\n<p>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span><em><strong>This publication is sponsored.

(formerly Janover Inc.) has set its sights on <a href=\"https://ambcrypto.com/category/solana-news/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Solana [SOL]</a>.</p>\n\n<p>According to a recent SEC <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805526/000121390025035609/ea0239372-s3_defi.htm#de_002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">filing</a>, the company aims to raise a staggering $1 billion through securities sales to steadily accumulate SOL tokens.</p>\n<p>A fresh report from Coinbase reveals that the firm has already secured $42 million for Solana purchases, hinting that this is merely the beginning of a much broader initiative.</p>\n<p>With this strategy gaining momentum, the crypto community has dubbed the trend “Solana MSTR,” as corporate players increasingly bet on Solana’s long-term value.</p>\n<p>Remarking on the same, the firm claimed,</p>\n<blockquote><p>“[DeFi Development] has adopted a treasury policy under which the principal holding in its treasury reserve on the balance sheet will be allocated to digital assets, starting with Solana. The Board of Directors approved the Company’s new treasury policy on April 4, 2025, authorizing long-term accumulation of Solana.”</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Is Solana becoming the next big thing after Bitcoin?</h2>\n<p>In addition, the company plans to register 1,244,471 shares of common stock for resale by existing shareholders, using the liquidity from these transactions to fund its Solana acquisition efforts.</p>\n<p>Besides that, the company, which now trades under the ticker symbol DFDV on Nasdaq, also aims to establish one or more Solana validators, allowing it to stake assets, secure the network, and earn rewards for reinvestment.</p>\n<p>While corporate investment in Solana is still relatively small compared to Bitcoin, DeFi Development’s ambition to become a significant player could mirror the influence that Strategy has had on Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>Strategy’s bold BTC accumulation strategy not only reshaped its own business model but also helped elevate Bitcoin’s legitimacy.</p>\n<p>Similarly, DeFi Development’s strategic focus on Solana could play a pivotal role in solidifying the blockchain’s position in the broader market.</p>\n<h2>Is Strategy acting as a torch-bearer?</h2>\n<p>Needless to say, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has become a guiding light for many companies with its groundbreaking Bitcoin strategy.</p>\n<p>One notable example is Metaplanet, often referred to as “Asia’s MicroStrategy,” which draws heavy inspiration from the U.S.-based firm’s approach to corporate treasury management.</p>\n<p>In fact, on the 14th of April, Michael Saylor, the founder of Strategy, made headlines by <a href=\"https://ambcrypto.com/all-about-michael-saylors-strategy-and-its-latest-bitcoin-purchase-good-news/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">announcing</a> the acquisition of an additional 3,459 Bitcoin for $285.8 million, bringing the company’s total holdings to a staggering 531,644 BTC.</p>\n<p>This move further solidifies Strategy’s position as a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin accumulation, inspiring other firms to consider similar strategies for diversifying their balance sheets and embracing digital assets as a store of value.</p>\n<p>Therefore, as DeFi Development Corp. ventures into the world of Solana, it is clear that the innovative paths forged by Strategy and other corporate entities could shape the future of crypto investments across multiple blockchains.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t</div></div>",

This move, <strong>officially announced by Kraken and acknowledged by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao</strong>, sees BNB entering broader markets, enhancing its competitive stance among major cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p><strong>With BNB’s inclusion on Kraken</strong>, the immediate implications include increased accessibility for U.S. and European markets. This strategy is particularly significant as regulatory landscapes evolve, providing an opportunity for BNB to <strong>elevate its market presence and liquidity</strong> drastically.</p>\n\n<blockquote>“Trading platforms need trading volume. For many years, many centralized exchanges (CEX) have been reluctant to list BNB, missing out on the high trading volume brought by this top five market cap cryptocurrency. Now they are starting to catch up. While this intensifies the competition Binance faces, it is beneficial for BNB itself. I am pleased to see Kraken start supporting BNB trading.”</blockquote>\n<h2>Historical Momentum and Regulatory Strategy Fuel BNB Growth</h2>\n<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Kraken’s addition of major tokens historically led to trading activity spikes, akin to past integrations.</p>\n<p>BNB, priced at $608.55, holds a market cap of $85.74 billion with a 2.90% dominance. Despite a recent 1.22% increase over the last 24 hours, its trading volume dropped by 12.08%. As of April 26, 2025, data from CoinMarketCap highlights these dynamics.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <a href=\"https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BNB-daily-chart-on-2149-UTC-on-April-26-2025file.jpeg\">\n    <img width=\"1072\" height=\"477\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201072%20477'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"bnb-daily-chart-39\" title=\"Kraken Announces Support for Binance Coin Trading 1\" data-lazy-srcset=\"//coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BNB-daily-chart-on-2149-UTC-on-April-26-2025file.jpeg 1072w, //coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BNB-daily-chart-on-2149-UTC-on-April-26-2025file-300x133.jpeg 300w, //coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BNB-daily-chart-on-2149-UTC-on-April-26-2025file-1024x456.jpeg 1024w, //coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BNB-daily-chart-on-2149-UTC-on-April-26-2025file-768x342.jpeg 768w, //coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BNB-daily-chart-on-2149-UTC-on-April-26-2025file-24x11.jpeg 24w, //coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BNB-daily-chart-on-2149-UTC-on-April-26-2025file-36x16.jpeg 36w, //coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BNB-daily-chart-on-2149-UTC-on-April-26-2025file-48x21.jpeg 48w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px\" data-lazy-src=\"//coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BNB-daily-chart-on-2149-UTC-on-April-26-2025file.jpeg\">\n  </a>\n  <figcaption>BNB(BNB), daily chart, screenshot on CoinMarketCap at 21:49 UTC on April 26, 2025. <em>Source: <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CoinMarketCap</a></em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The Coincu research team emphasizes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1912937547820388563\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kraken’s strategic expansion</a> and regulatory readiness as key drivers.

The incident did not result in noticeable Solana market fluctuations, highlighting its limited immediate impact.</p>\n<h2>Hack Alert and Security Concerns Spark Solana Community Vigilance</h2>\n<p>The social media post from the account thought to belong to Paul Atkins drew the crypto community’s attention when it featured a Solana on-chain token contract address. Speculations suggest a possible hacking incident, although no official confirmation has been provided. While there are no primary statements from Atkins or the SEC, the post’s prompt deletion contributed to community vigilance regarding account security. Significant implications rest not on the potential exposure of sensitive Solana data but on the perceived vulnerability of high-profile accounts to digital attacks.</p>\n<p>There has been no substantial market shift or liquidity changes directly linked to this incident within the Solana ecosystem. In contrast, the broader regulatory context under Atkins, as he pushes for an innovation-friendly and less enforcement-heavy atmosphere, marks a notable shift. <strong><a href=\"https://coincu.com/326017-sec-delays-spot-crypto-etf-decisions/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://coincu.com/326017-sec-delays-spot-crypto-etf-decisions/\">Eric Balchunas</a></strong> from Bloomberg highlighted the ongoing anticipation of SEC decisions with regards to pending crypto-related ETFs, including those linked to Solana.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Eric Balchunas, ETF Analyst</blockquote><blockquote>“There are now 72 crypto-related ETFs sitting with the SEC awaiting approval to list or list options. Everything from XRP, Litecoin and Solana to Penguins, Doge and 2x Melania and everything in between. Gonna be a wild year.”</blockquote>\n<h2>Analyzing Solana’s Market Resilience Post-Incident</h2>\n<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> In 2020, a major Twitter Bitcoin scam targeting high-profile accounts led to a similar response: rapid post deletions and limited market impact.

      "content": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div data-td-block-uid=\"tdi_122\">\n<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) recently made a technical move that caught the attention of many traders. After creating an ascending triangle pattern, the meme coin reached a significant resistance level of approximately $0.168.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supply and demand data suggest that buyers currently show remarkable commitment due to the formation of a positive chart pattern. According to crypto analysts, since DOGE’s price is trading near $0.1820, bulls may drive it toward breaking the $0.20 ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-dogecoin-price-breaks-key-resistance-as-bullish-pattern-forms\"><strong>Dogecoin Price Breaks Key Resistance as Bullish Pattern Forms</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/04/17/dogecoin-price-holds-support-after-false-breakout-potential-bull-run/\">DOGE price</a> demonstrated an ascending triangle breakout while continuing to form higher lows during the past week. The pattern displayed growing demand, which attracted more participants to buy the cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DOGE’s value surpassed the resistance threshold at $0.168. It produced valid verification after it crossed the barrier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts established key support points at 1.272, matching the value at $0.18025, 1.414 at $0.18673, and 1.618 at $0.19445. The price points function as potential seller entry points since prior rallies experienced slowing momentum in these locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dogecoin price must maintain its upward trend and attract new buyers to surpass the technical indicators before reaching $0.20.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"673\" src=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-991-1024x673.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-991-1024x673.png 1024w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-991-300x197.png 300w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-991-768x504.png 768w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-991-1536x1009.png 1536w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-991-150x99.png 150w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-991-696x457.png 696w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-991-1068x702.png 1068w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-991.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>Source: X</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Analysts also provided extended-term price targets for estimation. Price data from previous periods indicated DOGE reached more than a 500% increase after several consecutive higher low points formed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As projected from current price trends, the price can reach $0.6533 during the future rallying pattern. However, these figures remain speculative.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-critical-support-levels-and-retest-zones-are-now-in-focus\"><strong>Critical Support Levels and Retest Zones are Now in Focus</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After breaking out the triangle pattern, <a href=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/04/17/dogecoin-price-holds-support-after-false-breakout-potential-bull-run/\">DOGE traded</a> inside a narrow range between $0.15 and $0.18. The price had tested both ends of this range but returned inside each time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That indicated indecision before the recent breakout. During this time, analysts noted the importance of the $0.168 zone as a potential support level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Market participants monitored whether the price breakout triggered a shift in support and resistance (S/R), where the prior resistance turned into a new base area. The trading area at $0.168 became the chosen entry point for long positions, with stop-loss orders placed under this price mark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the provided price targets, DOGE had a following destination at $0.181. It could also have reached $0.20 if its present value stayed constant.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"477\" src=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-992-1024x477.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-992-1024x477.png 1024w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-992-300x140.png 300w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-992-768x358.png 768w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-992-1536x715.png 1536w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-992-150x70.png 150w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-992-696x324.png 696w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-992-1068x497.png 1068w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-992.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>Source: X</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>If the price regressed below the $0.168 zone, it would be reevaluated at the $0.155 level. A bullish outlook for DOGE persisted, as the price remained above $0.16.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The continuation of this trend depends on volume confirmation. That’s because past failed breakouts occurred when volume and momentum remained weak.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-daily-chart-signals-trend-reversal-with-higher-targets\"><strong>Daily Chart Signals Trend Reversal With Higher Targets</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Javon Marks, Dogecoin price followed a descending trendline since early 2021, but recent price action showed a shift. A pattern of rising highs and rising lows formed on the daily chart, signaling a potential change in trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That structure indicated strengthening bullish momentum. It also suggested the possibility of a positive breakout in the near term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/04/17/dogecoin-price-holds-support-after-false-breakout-potential-bull-run/\">DOGE price</a> established its latest support level at $0.14, thereby creating stability that surpassed the current market uptrend. Analysts predicted DOGE price would succeed in its rising trend by reaching potential resistance levels at $0.20178 and then proceeding to $0.22888.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-993-1024x575.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-993-1024x575.png 1024w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-993-300x168.png 300w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-993-768x431.png 768w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-993-1536x862.png 1536w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-993-150x84.png 150w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-993-696x391.png 696w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-993-1068x599.png 1068w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-993.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>Source: X</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>While short-term fluctuations may cause price pullbacks, the overall market structure suggests growing interest in DOGE. Backing the bullish momentum, Dogecoin price swayed between a high of $0.1863 and a low of $0.1643 in the last 24 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When writing, bullish momentum was still in control. Dogecoin price traded at $0.1820, marking an 11.47% surge from the intraday low. During the rally, Dogecoin’s market capitalization and 24-hour trading volume soared by 11.27% and 97.31%, respectively, reaching $27.27 billion and $1.96 billion.</p>\n</div><div data-td-block-uid=\"tdi_123\">\n\n<p><h4><span>Disclaimer</span></h4></p><p>The contents of this page are intended for general informational purposes and do not constitute financial, investment, or any other form of advice.

Ripple works with <a href=\"https://x.com/StellarNews007/status/1916121216772907506\">major financial institutions</a> like Bank of America and SBI, supporting international banking systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Stellar is closely tied to humanitarian projects, with the United Nations using it for blockchain-based aid and Franklin Templeton using it for tokenizing assets.</p><p>Jed McCaleb’s exit from Ripple wasn’t an accident; it was part of a well-timed plan. As Ripple focused on the institutional side, McCaleb’s Stellar project set out to bring the power of blockchain to the people.</p></div><!-- .entry-content /--><!-- .toggle-post-content -->  <!-- .share-buttons /-->  </article><!-- #the-post /--><div><h2>We'd Love to Hear Your Thoughts on This Article!</h2><div><h4>Was this writing helpful?</h4></div></div>   <!-- .post-components /--></div></div>",

This is huge for Ripple and its community, as it opens up new doors for mainstream investment. Meanwhile, Brett coin delivered an insane 89% weekly gain, outshining DOGE and SHIB - but will this continue or face a pullback? Bitcoin surged past $94k on a bad day for stocks, with gold and bonds selling off due to US economic uncertainty.\n\nArizona's legislature just voted on two Bitcoin reserve bills that could make the state a pioneer in U.S. crypto law. But don't get too excited - a gubernatorial veto might be coming because of unrelated budget disputes. And hey, if you're looking for some top crypto picks for 2025, privacy coins, smart contracts, speed, and meme power are your friends.\n\nBlockDAG's presale is on fire with an explosive return of 2,380% and innovative features leading the way in crypto this year. Solana just got a $1 billion investment from DeFi Development Corp, similar to MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy that changed everything last time around. Kraken listed Binance Coin, boosting exposure for the crypto giant.\n\nSEC Chairman Paul Atkins' account got hacked, and there was some drama with SOL tokens. On with the news:",
