The imposition of hefty tariffs—25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, and 10% on Chinese goods—has reshaped economic dynamics, inadvertently bolstering Russia’s position in the crypto-mining sector. These measures, intended to protect American industries, have driven up operational costs for miners in the U.S., where electricity and hardware expenses are now significantly inflated.</p>\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https://www.cointrackdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trump-bitcoin-3.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" data-srcset=\"https://www.cointrackdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trump-bitcoin-3.webp 1200w, https://www.cointrackdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trump-bitcoin-3-300x158.webp 300w, https://www.cointrackdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trump-bitcoin-3-1024x538.webp 1024w, https://www.cointrackdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trump-bitcoin-3-768x403.webp 768w, https://www.cointrackdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trump-bitcoin-3-150x79.webp 150w, https://www.cointrackdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trump-bitcoin-3-450x236.webp 450w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" src=\"https://www.cointrackdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trump-bitcoin-3.webp\" srcset=\"https://www.cointrackdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trump-bitcoin-3.webp 1200w, https://www.cointrackdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trump-bitcoin-3-300x158.webp 300w, https://www.cointrackdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trump-bitcoin-3-1024x538.webp 1024w, https://www.cointrackdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trump-bitcoin-3-768x403.webp 768w, https://www.cointrackdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trump-bitcoin-3-150x79.webp 150w, https://www.cointrackdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trump-bitcoin-3-450x236.webp 450w\"></p>\n<p>Russia, by contrast, enjoys abundant energy resources and lower operational overheads, creating a fertile ground for Bitcoin mining. Industry analysts note that the nation’s vast hydroelectric and natural gas reserves provide a cost-effective power supply, enabling miners to maximise profits despite volatile cryptocurrency markets. The U.S., once a dominant player in this space, is witnessing a gradual exodus of mining operations to regions with fewer economic constraints, with Russia reaping the rewards.</p>\n<p>Compounding this shift, Trump’s tariffs have disrupted the supply chain for mining equipment, much of which originates from China. The increased costs have squeezed smaller U.S. operators, forcing some to scale back or shutter entirely. Meanwhile, Russian firms, less reliant on imported hardware, have capitalised on this disruption, expanding their footprint in the global mining network. Data from blockchain analytics underscores this trend, revealing a surge in Russia’s share of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate.</p>\n<p>Yet, this windfall for Russia raises questions about the broader implications of such economic policies. While Trump’s tariffs aim to bolster domestic manufacturing, they may inadvertently cede ground to geopolitical rivals in emerging tech sectors. For now, Russia’s crypto-mining industry is thriving, its rigs humming in the Siberian cold, as the global race for digital wealth takes an unexpected turn.</p>\n<!-- CONTENT END 1 -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t</article></div>",

This milestone emerges as a pivotal development in the digital currency landscape, largely attributed to Circle’s strategic partnership with Binance.</p>\n<p>The stablecoin market is witnessing a significant shift in dynamics, with USDC’s ascendancy occurring alongside a noticeable decline in Tether’s USDT trading activity. Data analytics firm Kaiko reports that USDT volumes on centralised exchanges have experienced a substantial decrease, nearly halving between November 2024 and April 2025.</p>\n<p>Market analysts attribute this transformation to broader cryptocurrency trading patterns, particularly Bitcoin’s recent performance struggles at crucial resistance levels of $90,000 and $95,000. The resulting market uncertainty has prompted a shift in trader behaviour, with many participants displaying increased risk aversion.</p>\n<p>The regulatory landscape appears increasingly favourable for USDC, particularly in light of the European Union’s forthcoming Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation. Circle’s commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance positions USDC advantageously against its competitors, notably USDT, as the industry adapts to stricter oversight.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 1 -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\t\n\t\t\t</article></div>",

Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2><p>Bitcoin rebounded off the 20-day exponential moving average ($93,091) on May 6, indicating that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196ab86-e60a-7cdd-a866-2e926a0e13e6\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>There is minor resistance at $97,895, but if the level is crossed, the BTC/USDT pair could challenge the psychological resistance at $100,000. Sellers are expected to vigorously defend the level because a break above it could propel the pair to $107,000.</p><p>Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could tumble to the 50-day simple moving average ($87,441).</p><h2>Ether price prediction</h2><p>The bears are struggling to pull Ether <!----> below the moving averages, indicating a lack of selling at lower levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196ab86-eb5b-7300-b626-e3c7b78bf937\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>Buyers will try to take advantage of the situation and push the price above the immediate resistance at $1,873. If they do that, the ETH/USDT pair could pick up momentum and soar toward $2,111. There is minor resistance at $1,957, but it is likely to be scaled.&nbsp;</p><p>Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to tug the price below the moving averages, opening the gates for a fall to $1,537. Buyers will try to defend the $1,537 level, but if they fail in their endeavor, the pair may collapse to the vital support at $1,368.</p><h2>XRP price prediction</h2><p>XRP <!----> fell below the moving averages on May 4, but the bears could not sink the price to the $2 support.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196ab86-f0fa-7e48-bced-fa914ad74c43\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>XRP/USDT daily chart.

The pair could then rally toward $3. Conversely, a break and close below $2 opens the gates for a collapse to the $1.72 to $1.61 support zone.</p><h2>BNB price prediction</h2><p>The failure of the bears to sustain BNB <!----> below the moving averages indicates demand at lower levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196ab86-f64d-7859-af62-fa94c107ef71\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>BNB/USDT daily chart.

Sellers will try to halt the recovery at $644, but if the bulls prevail, the next stop could be $680.</p><p>This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the BNB/USDT pair turns down and breaks below the $576 support. That heightens the risk of a fall to $520. Buyers are expected to aggressively defend the $500 to $520 zone.</p><h2>Solana price prediction</h2><p>Solana <!----> is finding support at the moving averages, signaling a positive sentiment where dips are being purchased.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196ab86-fbe6-70eb-85c4-2282a8e2ed1c\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>SOL/USDT daily chart.

If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could climb to $180 and then to $200. That signals the pair may swing inside the large $110 to $260 range for a while.</p><p>Sellers will have to drag the price below the 20-day EMA to prevent the upside. The pair could then tumble to the 50-day SMA ($133). That indicates a consolidation between $110 and $153 for a few days.</p><h2>Dogecoin price prediction</h2><p>Dogecoin <!----> has been clinging to the moving averages, signaling a balance between supply and demand.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196ab87-0190-7ce3-a183-9e1759ec92c4\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart.

The bulls will attempt to keep the pair inside the range by buying near $0.14.</p><p>On the upside, buyers will have to drive and maintain the price above $0.21 to suggest a short-term trend change. The pair could rally to $0.25 and subsequently to the pattern target of $0.28.</p><h2>Cardano price prediction</h2><p>Cardano <!----> is witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers near the moving averages.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196ab87-073f-7101-aa32-8af760b1903d\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>ADA/USDT daily chart.

If the price moves up from the current level, it is expected to face selling at $0.75. A break and close above $0.75 could propel the pair to $0.83.</p><p>On the downside, there is solid support at $0.58. If the price rebounds off $0.58, the ADA/USDT pair could form a range. Sellers will seize control on a break below the $0.58 support.

The pair risks dropping to the solid support at $2.86 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.61).</p><h2>Chainlink price prediction</h2><p>Chainlink <!----> is finding support at the 50-day SMA ($13.66), but the failure to start a strong rebound suggests the bears have kept up the pressure.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196ab87-11f5-7b6a-844c-db04464dadd5\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>LINK/USDT daily chart.

But as Ansgar Dietrichs <a href=\"https://x.com/adietrichs/status/1920082921873870859\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">pointed out</a>, saturation of this new capacity would be good for Ethereum, provided it can continue scaling bandwidth to avoid too much fee pressure as demand grows.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><span><span><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcO_eL5-nOFyGE8bOf11k4-Rkabi35gY7gEchuAOpxf6tC1UHm5-N8FNmzhXR7yPsexGK_euqXpg947WIZDrynrFisoDp_YQVaxnBisClAyjfpYPRW02gXyU7i6PrwxfVkxAGlHRQ?key=50kD8TET5WXoo_sD0HAAfw\" alt=\"\" pinger-seen=\"true\"></span></span><figcaption><em>Source: <a href=\"https://x.com/hildobby_/status/1920067472960762207\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">@hildobby</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"validator-ux-and-efficiency\"><strong>Validator UX and efficiency</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pectra raises the maximum effective validator balance from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, which <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/podcast/bellcurve/9fd1a758-a922-11ee-85f0-2bb0374896a4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">Alluvial</a> co-founder Matt Leisinger calls “a meaningful unlock for institutions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Institutions can now autocompound rewards natively — no more skimming and aggregating 32 ETH to stay efficient,” Leisinger told Blockworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bohdan Opryshko at Everstake thinks it may be the “most institution-friendly update yet.” He notes EIP-7002 also allows validators to exit using execution-layer controls, reducing trust assumptions for stakers and protocols alike — altogether making “staking at scale with operational clarity” possible for more conservative capital.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-happens-next\">What happens next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pectra sets the stage for <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-consensus-evm-upgrade-fusaka-devs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">Fusaka</a>, Ethereum’s next major upgrade — now tentatively pushed to 2026. That fork is expected to introduce PeerDAS, a more efficient data availability sampling scheme for rollups, and continue laying the groundwork for future upgrades like <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-developers-consider-evm-upgrade\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">Verkle trees</a> and full account abstraction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the coming months, attention will shift to ecosystem adoption as teams try to showcase the real-world capabilities of the upgrade.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How will wallets, L2s and dapps move to support <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/vitalik-buterin-eip-account-abstraction\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">EIP-7702</a>? We can expect features like batched transactions, gas sponsorship and stablecoin fee payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to OP Labs’ Sam McIngvale, “apps drive this adoption curve.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Wallets will follow once there’s clear demand,” McIngvale told Blockworks. “If widely adopted, 7702 could finally make one-click onboarding and abstracted UX the norm.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that rollups can post more data to Ethereum cheaply, how long will it take to saturate that bandwidth? This could have consequences for rollups’ adoption of alternative DA layers such as <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/eigenlayer-restaking-mantle-zksync\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">EigenDA</a>, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/celestia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">Celestia</a> and <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/avail\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">Avail</a>. If L2 activity fails to match blob supply, scaling momentum could stall. Conversely, if demand rises too quickly, Ethereum may need to accelerate PeerDAS or further blob increases to prevent bottlenecks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Large operators can collapse thousands of validators into a few, but testnets couldn’t simulate how much that will improve efficiency, so it will be interesting to observe the concrete effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solo stakers may benefit indirectly, according to Preston van Loon, a core developer with <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/offchain-labs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">Offchain Labs</a>. Fewer attestations from consolidated validators means lower network bandwidth requirements. “It really does help everybody,” van Loon told Blockworks. “It’s hard to say which group has the outsized benefit.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dashboards tracking validator set composition, message propagation and slashing rates will become key indicators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The “unpredictability of network behavior” may be a risk in the future, MIT professor and <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/optimum-ram-web3-protocol-memory-decentralized\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">Optimum</a> co-founder Muriel Médard warned. “As blob sizes and message throughput increase, Ethereum’s ability to propagate data efficiently and predictably will define how far it can scale,” Médard told Blockworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering the fork involved more EIPs than any prior upgrade, Pectra’s <a href=\"https://x.com/elbuenmayini/status/1920082396625375387?s=46&amp;t=yjAdM2ddX0KgGQimu7jcDQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">quiet launch</a> may signal just how much <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/ethereum\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" node=\"[object Object]\">Ethereum</a> has matured as a decentralized protocol.

Joined by CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill, Kumar shared insights into Layer3’s business model, future goals, and the broader trends shaping the crypto industry.Redefining User-Owned ValueLayer3’s core mission centers on \"user-owned value,\" a concept that flips the traditional advertising model on its head. Kumar explained, “When a user is spending time on Layer3, they're actually able to earn, in addition to discovering and finding protocols relevant to their needs and interests.” Unlike traditional platforms like Google or Facebook, which monetize user attention for corporate profit, Layer3 ensures users share the economic value generated from their activity.By fostering this shift, Layer3 provides users a more direct connection to protocols and projects within the crypto ecosystem. Kumar elaborated,“What we're trying to basically convey is this notion of a user who spends time but also earns economic value while being advertised to.”The Journey from Traditional Finance to CryptoKumar’s background in traditional finance significantly shaped his approach to Layer3. He previously worked at Accolade Partners, a prominent alternative asset manager, where he gained experience in venture capital and technology investments.“We looked at what was happening in crypto venture and said it resembles a lot of what was happening in the 80s and 90s within traditional venture capital,” Kumar noted.This unique perspective allowed Kumar to recognize the potential of the crypto space early on. He emphasized that his financial experience taught him the importance of robust business models and defensibility. “Understanding business models and thinking about them in a dispassionate way was essential,” he said, adding that the experience helped him make strategic choices in La</p></div></li><li id=\"v-1\"><div><p>CryptoSlate SlateCast</p><p>Decentralizing AI infrastructure with Gaurav Sharma, CTO of io.net</p><p>In a recent SlateCast episode, Gaurav Sharma, CTO of io.net, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill to discuss io.net’s groundbreaking approach to decentralized infrastructure for AI. With a background at tech giants like Binance and Amazon, Sharma brings deep expertise in scaling technology to a decentralized platform. io.net is paving the way for a decentralized ecosystem that aims to democratize access to AI resources, reduce costs, and enable greater innovation.The Vision Behind io.netSharma explained io.net’s role as a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) that leverages community-powered hardware.“Our inventory comes from the community,” Sharma noted. “We don’t own our hardware; we aggregate it from individuals, data centers, and companies.”This model drastically reduces user costs compared to centralized giants like Amazon Web Services (AWS).He highlighted the efficiency of this model:“For instance, an H100 GPU on a centralized platform might cost eight times more than what we offer. Our decentralized model empowers startups by cutting costs and enabling them to allocate resources toward innovation.”Challenges in Decentralized AI InfrastructureBuilding a decentralized AI system presents unique challenges. Sharma emphasized the need for robust distributed systems, scalability, and transparency.“Decentralized infrastructure cannot rely on monolithic tech stacks,” he explained. “The team must excel at distributed systems and computational fundamentals.”Moreover, latency sensitivity and scalability were critical from day one, as io.net’s users often come from high-demand enterprises. Sharma also stressed the importance of trust and transparency in the crypto ecosystem.“Our block explorer showcases every aspect of our network, from GPU availability to revenue metrics.

CrossFi’s mission is to provide seamless financial inclusivity through a robust ecosystem that supports non-custodial crypto transactions, partnerships with banks, and scalable blockchain technology.Alexeev described CrossFi as “the Apple Pay for crypto,” emphasizing its role as a bridge between decentralized finance (DeFi) and mainstream banking.“Our focus has always been empowering users by removing gatekeepers while providing access to advanced financial tools,” he said.Non-Custodial Payments RedefinedAt its core, CrossFi offers a unique payment technology enabling users to transact directly from their Web3 wallets at any point-of-sale terminal worldwide. This approach eliminates the need for custodial platforms, maintaining users’ control over their funds. Alexeev highlighted the platform's ability to “connect any Web3 wallet to the CrossFi app,” facilitating crypto-to-fiat transactions seamlessly and securely.Unlike traditional crypto cards, CrossFi partners directly with banks to interact with smart contracts, bypassing third-party intermediaries.“We’ve designed an ecosystem with fewer points of failure while forcing banks to innovate and adopt crypto technology,” Alexeev explained.Why Build a New Layer-1 Blockchain?Addressing the decision to build a proprietary layer-1 blockchain, Alexeev acknowledged the challenges of integrating blockchain with existing banking infrastructure.“No existing blockchain met the security, scalability, and compatibility requirements of traditional banks,” he stated.The customized blockchain allows CrossFi to support seamless interaction between decentralized technologies and institutional frameworks.Flat Fees for TransparencyCrossFi aims to disrupt conventional payment systems </p></div></li><li id=\"v-3\"><div><p>CryptoSlate SlateCast</p><p>Uphold CEO Simon McLoughlin talks stablecoins, regulation, and the future of crypto on SlateCast</p><p>In a recent episode of the SlateCast, CryptoSlate's Editor-in-Chief, Liam \"Akiba\" Wright, sat down with Simon McLoughlin, CEO of Uphold, to discuss key developments in the cryptocurrency space. Their conversation covered the evolution of stablecoins, regulatory changes, and the increasing intersection of AI and crypto. McLoughlin shared insights on how Uphold is positioning itself as a leader in the digital finance space, offering transparency, regulatory compliance, and innovation to its users.Regulatory Shifts and Market SentimentMcLoughlin expressed optimism about the future of the crypto industry, citing significant regulatory shifts in the United States.\"Who would have thought six months ago that we would have Hester Peirce heading up the SEC Working Group for Crypto, Cynthia Lummis chairing the Senate Committee on Digital Assets, and the removal of SAB 121?\" he remarked.Despite recent sell-offs in the market, McLoughlin remains confident.\"These sell-offs are natural market phenomena. The fundamentals are stronger than ever, and institutional adoption is pushing Bitcoin closer to being treated like a traditional risk asset.\"Stablecoins as a Catalyst for Financial InnovationOne of the major topics of discussion was the rapid growth of stablecoins. According to McLoughlin, the stablecoin market exceeded $200 billion in 2023 and could reach $300 billion in the near future.\"The value proposition is clear: send a dollar anywhere in the world in less than a second for less than a cent,\" he explained. \"Traditional banking systems struggle with cross-border transactions, and stablecoins offer a seamless alternative.\"Uphold is capitalizing on this shift by expanding its stablecoin offerings across multiple blockchains.\"We currently support five stablecoins on 15 blockchains, and by next month, that will increase to 34 blockchains. Payments companies need a seamless infrastructure, and we provide the necessary accessibility and security,\" McLoughlin added.Uphold’s Approa</p></div></li><li id=\"v-4\"><div><p>CryptoSlate SlateCast</p><p>Mark Yusko discusses Metaplanet Bitcoin buys and BTC’s future</p><p>In a recent SlateCast episode, Mark Yusko, CEO and co-founder of Morgan Creek Capital Management, joined host Liam “Akiba” Wright and CryptoSlate Senior Analyst James Van Straten to discuss Bitcoin’s future, market manipulation, and the evolution of money.Yusko shared insights on Bitcoin’s value proposition, the impact of ETFs, and the broader implications of crypto adoption.Bitcoin’s Value and Price PredictionsYusko explained his prediction of Bitcoin reaching $250,000 in the coming years, basing it on the total value of the Bitcoin network. He stated:“If it’s going to replace gold, the value of gold globally is about $12 trillion. Half of that doesn’t really count… The monetary value of gold, the bars that sit in central banks, that’s about $6 trillion.”He further elaborated on the four-year cycle driven by Bitcoin halving events, suggesting that the fair value of Bitcoin doubles with each halving. Yusko predicted that the current cycle could see Bitcoin reach $100,000 as fair value, potentially reaching $1 million in the next cycle.Market Manipulation and Price SuppressionThe discussion touched on market manipulation, with Yusko drawing parallels between Bitcoin and gold markets. He argued that both are subject to price suppression:“The Rothschild Bank in London, which sets the price of gold globally, has been fixing that price through this manipulation of the futures market for years.”Yusko expressed concern about applying similar tactics to Bitcoin, particularly with the introduction of ETFs and the growth of the futures market.The Evolution of Money and Financial SystemsYusko provided a historical perspective on the evolution of information dissemination and financial systems. He argued that Bitcoin and blockchain technology represent the next significant shift:“We’re about to bust the oldest monopoly in the world left, which is financial services. Banking, right?

      "title": "The No-Code NFT Revolution: NFTs2Me Makes Shibarium Easier Than Ever",
      "content": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div>\n        \n\n\n\n\n<p>No coding, no perceived chaos – that’s the promise from NFTs2Me, a project featured in this Shibarium Builder Spotlight. It aims to open the door to NFT creation on Shibarium with a process designed to be as simple as click, upload, and go live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea driving NFTs2Me is to tackle a common frustration. Many artists, independent creators, or even small businesses are intrigued by the potential of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) but find the learning curve dauntingly steep.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’re solving the complexity and technical barriers of launching NFT projects,” said the <a href=\"https://nfts2me.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" title=\"\">NFTs2Me</a> team. They describe their platform as an all-in-one solution for those “who want to enter the NFT space on Shibarium without needing blockchain development skills.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This addresses a common friction point in Web3, the evolving, more decentralized internet. The promise of this new digital era often collides with the specialized knowledge required to build within it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NFTs2Me intends to be that bridge. The platform provides tools for crafting various NFT types – from one-of-a-kind art pieces to series of editions or algorithmically generated collections. It also manages the technical backend, like uploading files to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a distributed storage network, and then deploying the NFT’s smart contract onto the Shibarium <a href=\"https://shib.io/build\">blockchain</a>, reportedly with minimal fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the team is keen to emphasize that their offering extends beyond mere NFT minting. They highlight features designed to cultivate and manage a community around these digital assets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These include varied methods for acquiring NFTs, such as traditional credit card payments, the ability to set up custom web addresses for specific projects, and token-gated access, which restricts content to NFT holders. Tools for airdrops and tracking ownership are also <a href=\"https://shib.io/dapps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">integrated</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“People often assume we’re ‘just another NFT minting tool,'” the team explained, “but NFTs2Me is much more: it’s a complete NFT ecosystem builder.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to build on Shibarium, where their platform went live in the summer of 2023, was deliberate. The NFTs2Me team has been engaged with the <a href=\"https://news.shib.io/2025/04/22/shibarium-dev-spotlight-highlights-hachis-cross-chain-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">platform</a> since its inception.&nbsp;\n            \n<ins data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7883642476865726\" data-ad-slot=\"5108523302\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\"></ins>\n\n        </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were attracted, they stated, to Shibarium’s “low fees, scalability, and vibrant community.” These factors, they believe, make it “the ideal layer-2 to empower creators while tapping into the broader Shiba ecosystem’s energy and reach.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility remains a central theme. Their platform, currently operational, allows users to connect a digital wallet and begin the creation or deployment process almost instantly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To date, they have launched their comprehensive suite for NFT creation and deployment. As for future <a href=\"https://news.shib.io/2025/04/18/shibarium-dev-initiative-spotlights-shups-ecosystem-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">developments</a>?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’re expanding with on-chain community engagement tools to help creators build deeper connections with their audiences,” the team shared.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd8SQ1-tmh6EFS_Er93vZqJcWtaE0thnf0EXYm6aBR4hccFOvLrCF1Wjt_ugqFZ8_f6aHWhZexj65RfnrdGqHSc8rqmpmB5iN1bbXneARyLxOKWCfoXNLeXLao_j2vpZFe29hGK?key=TtclrUHMLlIJusuvqKTKBQ\" alt=\"Shibarium Builder Spotlight: NFTs2Me Eases NFT Creation\n\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>NFTs2Me’s long-term ambition is sweeping. “Our vision is to democratize NFT creation and ownership by becoming the <a href=\"https://docs.nfts2me.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" title=\"\">go-to no-code</a> NFT platform on Shibarium and beyond,” they articulated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<p><iframe title=\"Shibarium Builder Spotlight: NFTs2Me Eases NFT Creation\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXWhe3PJAU0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" name=\"fitvid0\"></iframe></p>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultimate aim is to enable a wide spectrum of users, from solo artists to established global brands, to launch and cultivate their digital communities independently, without technical intermediaries. For individuals within the Shibarium community eager to connect with the project, NFTs2Me welcomes feedback via their <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/Usmgxj2Msk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" title=\"\">Discord</a> server and encourages participation in NFT drops.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also express openness to collaborations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What appears to fuel their endeavor is the palpable dynamism they observe in the <a href=\"http://shibarium.shib.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" title=\"\">Shibarium</a> sphere. “What excites us most is the grassroots innovation and energy,” the team remarked. “We’re witnessing a shift where decentralized communities and creators are taking ownership of culture and digital identity.” And within that evolving landscape, NFTs2Me hopes to provide some of the crucial building blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Read More</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.shib.io/2025/04/22/shibarium-dev-spotlight-highlights-hachis-cross-chain-expansion/\">Shibarium Dev Spotlight Highlights Hachi’s Cross-Chain Expansion</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://news.shib.io/2025/04/18/shibarium-dev-initiative-spotlights-shups-ecosystem-hub/\">Shibarium Dev Initiative Spotlights Shups Ecosystem Hub</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://news.shib.io/2025/05/06/shibarium-builder-spotlight-shibalisa-art-aims-to-remake-art-world/\">Shibarium Builder Spotlight: ShibaLisa.art Aims to Remake Art World</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<ins data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7883642476865726\" data-ad-slot=\"3032259965\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\"></ins>\n<p><span></span> <span>Post Views:</span> <span>32</span>\n\t\t\t</p>    </div></div>",

Please consult our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tokenist.com/terms-of-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website policy</a>&nbsp;prior to making financial decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><p>Rocket technology is slowly but surely moving away from monumental government-centric projects. Even Intuitive Machines (NASDAQ: LUNR), having previously received a $4.8 billion NASA contract after revisiting the Moon, was outclassed by privately held <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/should-you-buy-the-intuitive-machines-lunr-dip/\" rel=\"dofollow\">Firefly Aerospace</a> in early March.</p><p>With wider access to space flight technology, more companies are able to claim space stock status. And with China’s Qianfan (Spacesail Constellation) to rival SpaceX’s Starlink coverage, governments are further incentivized to ease regulatory restrictions and boost funding.</p><p>But which companies are paving the road for a sustainable business model over the long run?</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ: ASTS)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p data-slot-rendered-content=\"true\">It is well known that telecom companies like Verizon (NYSE: VZ) are able to pay generous dividends because of their predictable cash flows for essential services. Based in Texas, AST SpaceMobile is making the right moves to have that strong financial position. Namely, the company contracts rocket companies to deploy 4G and 5G services in low Earth orbit (LEO).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This broadband space infrastructure builds up a subscription base in areas that have no coverage or where such coverage is difficult to achieve. So much so that AST partnered with major mobile network operators (MNOs), from AT&amp;T and Vodafone to Verizon, to offer AST’s satellite coverage as supplemental.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, AST receives revenue not only from monthly subscribers but also from international roaming and data transmission fees. In September 2024, the company launched its first five commercial BlueBird satellites via SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2025, AST crossed the milestone with the first-ever video call using this space infrastructure, having already crossed 4G/5G voice call milestones in 2023. Of course, as AST’s ambitious plans move forward, capital expenditures (capex) also go up with little movement in cash reserves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of early March 2025 for Q4 2024 earnings, AST beat the Zacks Consensus earnings per share (EPS) by 2 cents, at negative 18 cents and quarterly net loss of $35.9 million, which is up from the net loss of $31.9 million in the year-ago quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, ASTS shareholders are paying for the company to yet reach profitability. And that bet is based on AST’s space service getting embedded in regular broadband packages. The underlying thesis is that people will demand a peace of mind outside cell towers, especially after the historic power blackouts in Spain, Portugal and parts of France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on that premise, ASTS stock performed well, up nearly 18% year-to-date. Although there have been several steep declines, ASTS shares tend to recover quickly. Against the current ASTS price of $25.59, WSJ’s forecasting data shows an average price target of $42.27 per share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-slot-rendered-content=\"true\">In addition to that significant upside potential, the bottom target of $30 is above the current price level, suggesting an optimal exposure entry after the tariffs-induced <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/markets-continue-fall-as-trump-threatens-new-50-tariff-on-china/\" rel=\"dofollow\">market turmoil.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t\t<p><img width=\"42\" height=\"42\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2042%2042'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" data-lazy-src=\"https://tokenist.com/wp-content/themes/thetokenist/assets/img/del/cta-referral-1.png\"></p><p>Join our <a href=\"https://t.me/thetokenist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Telegram group</a> and never miss a breaking digital asset story.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h3>RocketLab USA (NASDAQ: RKLB)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the more consistent themes in our stock coverage is that RKLB shares should be considered at every dip opportunity. Instead of SpaceX being publicly traded, RocketLab is the first alternative for cost-effective LEO payload deployments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get to that status, RocketLab relied on smaller Electron rockets with up to 300kg payload capacity. Although this makes it less competitive against SpaceX’s medium-sized rockets at 22,800kg, the company offset this with two key approaches:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Leveraging the small satellite market, typically in deploying satellite constellations. Not only does their quantity supply sufficient demand, but RocketLab developed a new type of satellite, dubbed Flatellite, specifically to scale up manufacturing for large constellation deployments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Vertical integration – to get businesses to pick RocketLab for delivery, the company made it easier by integrating design, manufacturing, and mission management. For this reason, RocketLab divided its revenue into Launch Services and Space Systems, with the latter providing recurring revenue and higher margins.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Employing these two approaches, RocketLab demonstrated consistent competence, having conducted 63 Electron launches with only 4 failures. On May 17th, Electron is set for its 64th mission, delivering an imaging satellite for the iQPS constellation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, this is just the first stage of the company’s development. To join the medium-sized rocket arena, RocketLab has been developing a partially reusable Neutron rocket, set for launch in H2 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote data-slot-rendered-content=\"true\">\n<p>“We’re working hard to bring Neutron online with one of the fastest development schedules in history for a new rocket, because we know medium-lift launch opportunities are limited and space access is being stifled”</p>\n<cite>RocketLab CEO Sir Peter Beck in February</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Given the company’s track record, if Neutron milestone launch fails, investors should view it as a double-down on the dip opportunity. Similar to AST SpaceMobile, RocketLab is yet to enter profitability, having delivered $190 million net loss for FY2024 against $182.5 million net loss for FY2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the demand for RocketLab’s services are strong, evidenced by an 85% revenue increase from 2023 to 2024, at $289.85 million for the full year. At the end of 2024, the company reported $271 million in cash reserves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the deployment of Neutron rockets, the company is likely to secure future NASA contracts. In January, such inclusion was already added for RocketLab’s existing VADR contract from 2022. Moreover, the company is firmly embedding itself into the aerospace industrial complex, following the $5.6 billion <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/rocket-lab-rklb-joins-elite-group-with-5-6b-space-force-contract/\" rel=\"dofollow\">contract</a> for Space Force.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Year-to-date, RKLB stock is down 11%. Against the present price of $22.37, WSJ’s forecasting data points to an average RKLB price target of $25.03. However, the bottom estimate is significantly lower, at $14.35, mirroring Neutron concerns. The top RKLB price target is $33, while analysts overwhelmingly suggest buying, at 10, vs only 5 analysts who recommend holding.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p data-slot-rendered-content=\"true\"><em>Disclaimer: The author does not hold or have a position in any securities discussed in the article.</em> <em>All stock prices were quoted at the time of writing.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t</div><div>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<h4>About the author</h4>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://tokenist.com/about/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"112\" height=\"112\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20112%20112'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"Tim Fries\" data-lazy-src=\"https://tokenist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tim-9-112x112.jpg\">\n\t\t\t\t</a></p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tTim Fries is the cofounder of The Tokenist.
