The attestation is seen as a move to boost transparency and attract greater interest from both institutional and retail investors.</p>\n\n<p>Strong global demand for gold has provided additional momentum. Tether pointed to rising geopolitical tensions and fears of economic instability as major factors pushing investors toward safer assets like gold — and by extension, XAUT.</p>\n\n\n<p>Gold itself has had a standout year, with prices outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by over 32%, according to The Kobeissi Letter. Central banks are also ramping up their reserves, with global holdings now at their highest share of international reserves in 26 years. China has been particularly aggressive, doubling its gold reserves since early 2023.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino outlined plans to expand XAUT’s reach in emerging markets, aiming to offer the security of physical gold combined with the flexibility and speed of <a>blockchain</a> technology.</p><!-- CONTENT END 1 -->\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://t.me/coindoo_media\">\n        <img alt=\"telegram\" width=\"932\" height=\"236\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/themes/coinpress/images/Banner_en-US_Poppins_new.png\">\n    </a>\n</p><section>\n    <span>Author</span>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n                                <p><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-300x300.jpg 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-400x400.jpg 400w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-768x768.jpg 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-600x600.jpg 600w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n.jpg 1372w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\">                </p>\n                                            \n            </div>\n                <p>Alex is an experienced finance journalist and a cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiast.

Trump, his administration, and his family for creating an environment where innovation is encouraged. “Nexo is returning to America — stronger, smarter, and determined to win,” he added.</p><div id=\"placement_631314_0\"><p><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=183000&amp;plid=2742516&amp;setID=631314&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=943088&amp;banID=522709226&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;rnd=393061&amp;scheduleID=2676091&amp;adSize=300x250&amp;mt=1745877458702641&amp;sw=1280&amp;sh=720&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptopotato.com%2Fcrypto-lender-nexo-announces-us-re-entry%2F&amp;hc=dfa7e1be0a0b4843daddd454f8483f18f54268a8&amp;location=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4415894\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\"></a></p></div>\n\n<p>Donald Trump Jr. spoke on the importance of cryptocurrencies for the United States, emphasizing their role in maintaining the country’s economic leadership and technological advancement.</p>\n<p>“I think crypto is the future of finance,” said the president’s son. “We see the opportunity for the financial sector and want to ensure we bring that back to the U.S.,” he continued.</p>\n<p>He added that establishing a supportive regulatory framework would be crucial to empowering entrepreneurs and ensuring the nation’s competitiveness in the digital economy, emphasizing, “The key to everything crypto is going to be the regulatory framework.”</p>\n<p>The event, headlined by Donald Trump Jr. and Gila Gamliel, gathered prominent members of the global business community and leading figures from the investment and innovation sectors.</p>\n<h2>Regulatory Challenges That Led To the Exit</h2>\n<p>Nexo’s re-entry follows a challenging period marked by its gradual <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/nexo-is-leaving-the-united-states-due-to-regulatory-difficulties/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">withdrawal </a>from the U.S. market in December 2022. At that time, the firm cited regulatory uncertainty and conflicting guidance between state and federal authorities as the primary reasons for its exit.</p>\n<p>Despite engaging in over 18 months of discussions with regulators, the crypto lender struggled to find a solution to its problems. Efforts to comply included off-boarding clients from New York and Vermont and <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/nexo-reveals-date-when-it-will-halt-earn-program-for-us-customers/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">suspending</a> new registrations for its Earn Interest Product in several states. Ultimately, inconsistent regulatory positions and a prolonged investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) forced Nexo to stop its American operations.</p>\n<p>The company’s return follows a similar move by OKX, which <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/okx-returns-to-us-market-following-505m-doj-deal/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">announced</a> less than two weeks ago that it is reopening its U.S. crypto exchange and launching a new Web3 wallet for the nation’s users.</p>\n<div><center><span>SPECIAL OFFER (Sponsored)</span></center>\n<p><b>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive): <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Use this link</a> to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance</b> (<a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">full details</a>).</p><p>\n<b>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit: <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/pl/bybit24/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Use this link</a> to register and open a $500 FREE position on any coin!</b></p></div>\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<hr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t</article></div>",

Arizona is making moves too, passing an SBR bill that's got everyone convinced Trump will rally Bitcoin to $99k and beyond - but let's not get ahead of ourselves here. Mastercard just launched a global stablecoin payment system so you can use your crypto at millions of merchants worldwide - which is great for all the cash-haters out there.
