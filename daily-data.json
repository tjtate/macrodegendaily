      "content": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><article id=\"post-393738\">\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In its 2024 annual report, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) revealed a sharp rise in the number and severity of cryptocurrency-related fraud cases.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the year, the IC3 recorded over 140,000 complaints linked to cryptocurrency, which led to staggering financial losses of $9.3 billion.</p>\n<h2>Alarming Trend</h2>\n<p>A significant portion of these losses came from individuals aged 60 and above, who filed roughly 33,000 complaints and suffered a combined total of $2.8 billion in losses. This age group also saw the largest increase in both reported complaints and financial harm.</p>\n<p>The IC3’s <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2024_IC3Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">report</a> also noted a dramatic year-over-year increase in losses – 66% higher than in 2023, when total losses amounted to $5.6 billion. Investment scams involving cryptocurrency were the primary source of these losses, but the report also highlighted other schemes such as sextortion, where criminals manipulate personal content to coerce victims into sending money, and fraud involving crypto ATMs.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/chainalysis-report-reveals-rising-sophistication-in-crypto-crime/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">ransomware</a> attacks, which had been a recurring issue, showed a 9% rise in 2024, thereby posing a growing threat to critical infrastructure. Overall, fraud and crypto scams were the most significant contributors to the rise in reported cybercrimes, with older individuals particularly vulnerable to these high-stakes digital fraud schemes.</p><div id=\"placement_631314_0\"><p><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=183000&amp;plid=2924006&amp;setID=631314&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=1132751&amp;banID=523004140&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;rnd=6808470&amp;scheduleID=2866637&amp;adSize=300x250&amp;mt=1745792271838849&amp;sw=1280&amp;sh=720&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptopotato.com%2Folder-americans-hit-hard-by-crypto-scams-fbis-ic3-reports-2-8-billion-losses%2F&amp;hc=3879cbe2ab28d9e18d0f5ba566faaf96dbb82b3c&amp;location=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4506413\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\"></a></p></div>\n\n<p>On the other hand, pig butchering scams, which were once mainly targeted at older adults, are now increasingly affecting younger individuals, particularly those aged 30 to 49. A recent <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/over-5-5-billion-stolen-in-pig-butchering-scams-cyvers-reports/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">study</a> by Cyvers examined 150 major crypto platforms, revealing over 200,000 scam incidents and $5.5 billion in losses in 2024.</p>\n<p>The research focused on Ethereum-based scams and uncovered significant fraud across various platforms, including major exchanges, a crypto-friendly bank, and institutional trading platforms. The scale of impact varied, but the trend is clear: younger people are becoming the prime victims.</p>\n<h2>Operation Level Up</h2>\n<p>‘Operation Level Up’ was thus initiated with the assistance of FBI agents and the US Secret Service to address the growing issue of cryptocurrency investment fraud. Pig butchering involves fraudsters building online relationships with victims and convincing them to invest in a fraudulent cryptocurrency platform.</p>\n<p>As a result of this operation, a total of 4,323 individuals affected by cryptocurrency investment fraud were informed of the scam. Of these victims, 76% were unaware they had fallen victim to fraud. The estimated financial savings for these victims amounted to $285.6 million. Additionally, 42 victims were referred to an FBI victim specialist for support regarding potential suicidal thoughts.</p>\n<div><center><span>SPECIAL OFFER (Sponsored)</span></center>\n<p><b>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive): <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Use this link</a> to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance</b> (<a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">full details</a>).</p><p>\n<b>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit: <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/pl/bybit24/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Use this link</a> to register and open a $500 FREE position on any coin!</b></p></div>\n<!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<hr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t</article></div>",

See why BlockDAG, Ethereum, Solana, &amp; Aptos are the top contenders. Find out how to secure your spot before the next rally lifts prices higher.</p><p><span>As new opportunities tighten and investor competition intensifies, finding the top-performing crypto to buy has never been more critical. With projects like BlockDAG, Ethereum, Solana, and Aptos all charting unique growth paths, the choices made now could define who leads the next wave of winners in 2025.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Here’s a look at the top picks that are driving the most excitement across the market right now.</span></p>\n<h2><b>1. BlockDAG (BDAG): A Final Presale Push Before Listings&nbsp;</b></h2>\n\n<p><span>BlockDAG has flipped the script on traditional presales, making it one of the most compelling top-performing crypto to buy today. Now in batch 27, BlockDAG rolled back its token price to $0.0025—a major discount compared to its earlier $0.0248 high—giving new buyers a rare shot at early-stage pricing just before launch.</span></p>\n<p>With over 19.4 billion BDAG already sold and $219 million raised, <a href=\"https://blockdag.network/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BlockDAG’s </a>momentum continues to surge. Early buyers have seen a 2,380% <a>ROI</a> compared to batch 1 pricing, building strong urgency for late movers still considering entry.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blockdag.network/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235318.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1193\" height=\"149\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235318.jpg 1193w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235318-300x37.jpg 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235318-800x100.jpg 800w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235318-768x96.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1193px) 100vw, 1193px\"></a></p>\n<p><span>What’s adding fuel to the fire is BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles feature. Every day, 25 million BDAG are made available, and if they don’t fully sell, the day’s top buyer claims the remainder—an aggressive twist that’s turning final presale days into a scramble. With listings approaching, BlockDAG stands out clearly among the top-performing crypto to buy right now.</span></p>\n<h2><b>2. Ethereum (ETH): A Proven Foundation With Staying Power</b></h2>\n<p><span>Ethereum remains a dependable option for anyone seeking the top-performing crypto to buy with an eye on long-term resilience. Despite ongoing discussions around its scalability, Ethereum’s growing reliance on Layer 2 solutions and continuous upgrades keep it at the center of <a>blockchain</a> innovation.</span></p>\n<p><span>Whether it’s <a>DeFi</a>, NFTs, or institutional adoption, Ethereum continues to dominate headlines—and transaction volumes. As excitement builds around the next major crypto cycle, Ethereum’s role as a foundational asset makes it an essential part of any smart investor’s strategy during key accumulation periods.</span><span><br>\n</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75655\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75655\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235316.jpg\" alt=\"Solana coin on black background\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235316.jpg 600w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235316-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-75655\">solana</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><b>3. Solana (SOL): Fast, Affordable, and Positioned to Surge</b></h2>\n<p><span>Solana presents a strong case for those focused on the next top-performing crypto to buy. Famous for its lightning-fast transactions and low fees, Solana has carved out a significant role among developers building dApps and <a>NFT</a> marketplaces.</span></p>\n<p><span>While technical setbacks in the past raised questions, Solana’s consistent upgrades and a growing ecosystem are pushing it back into the spotlight. With more projects choosing Solana and institutional backing increasing, SOL is lining itself up for strong performance if broader crypto momentum returns.</span></p>\n<h2><b>4. Aptos (APT): New Tech, Big Potential</b></h2>\n<p><span>Aptos rounds out the list of top-performing crypto to buy, bringing fresh energy to the blockchain space with some serious backing behind it. Built by ex-Meta engineers, Aptos emphasizes scalability, efficiency, and robust security—traits that could see it rise quickly as adoption picks up.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blockdag.network/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235314.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235314.jpg 1200w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235314-300x169.jpg 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235314-711x400.jpg 711w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235314-768x432.jpg 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235314-915x515.jpg 915w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p>\n<p><span>Supported by major venture capital and an active developer community, Aptos is transitioning from a speculative newcomer to a potential mainstay. As the window closes for getting early positions in high-upside projects, Aptos offers a rare shot at capturing growth before it becomes fully priced in.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Which Top-Performing Crypto Will Lead?</b></h2>\n<p>The race for the<a href=\"https://blockdag.network/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> top-performing crypto</a> to buy is intensifying, and waiting too long could mean missing prime opportunities. BlockDAG’s strong presale performance, combined with its Buyer Battles-driven momentum, positions it as a standout heading toward its listing phase.</p>\n<p><span>Meanwhile, Ethereum’s established dominance, Solana’s efficiency push, and Aptos’s fresh innovation story create a strong case for building a diverse, future-ready portfolio. With timing becoming a critical factor, these projects offer some of the best setups for those aiming to ride the next big wave of crypto growth.</span>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://blockdag.network/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235313.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1193\" height=\"149\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235313.jpg 1193w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235313-300x37.jpg 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235313-800x100.jpg 800w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMAGE-2025-04-27-235313-768x96.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1193px) 100vw, 1193px\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span><em><strong>This publication is sponsored.

A close above $95,000 could propel the BTC/USDT pair to $100,000 and eventually to $107,000. Sellers are expected to aggressively defend the zone between $107,000 and $109,588.</p><p>The 20-day EMA is the critical near-term support to watch out for because a break below it brings the large $95,000 to $73,777 range into play.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-04/0196781c-f286-7b1f-8353-ebeac50f3ab9\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>BTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it enhances the prospects of a break above $95,000. The pair could then surge to $100,000.</p><p>Instead, if the price maintains below the 20-EMA, the pair could tumble to the 50-simple moving average.

That increases the likelihood of a break above $23.50. If that happens, the AVAX/USDT pair will complete a double-bottom pattern, which has a target objective of $31.73.</p><p>This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. The pair may then remain stuck inside the range for a few more days.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-04/0196781d-07a1-7410-82d0-d289c56b9c7f\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>AVAX/USDT 4-hour chart.

That suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher. If buyers propel the price above $23.10, the pair could surge to $25. There is resistance at $23.50, but it is likely to be crossed.</p><p>Alternatively, a drop below $21.60 signals that the bulls have given up.

If buyers drive the price above $16, the TRUMP/USDT pair may reach $17.69, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. However, if buyers bulldoze their way through, the pair could skyrocket to $19.60 and then to $22.40.</p><p>Conversely, a deeper pullback suggests that the short-term bulls are booking profits. The zone between $11.56 and $12.45 is expected to act as a solid support.&nbsp; If the price rebounds off the support zone, the pair may swing between $11.56 and $16 for some time.

That suggests the bulls are active at lower levels. Buyers will try to push the price above the $16 overhead resistance, starting the next leg of the uptrend.</p><p>Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-EMA suggests that the bullish momentum has weakened. The pair may then slump to $14 and later to the solid support near $12. Sellers will be back in the driver’s seat on a drop below $11.50.</p><h2>Bittensor price prediction</h2><p>Bittensor <!----> broke and closed above the downtrend line on April 20, suggesting that the bears are losing their grip.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-04/0196781d-17fe-7f36-b1e4-36437f931e4c\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>TAO/USDT daily chart.

If they succeed, the next stop may be $495.</p><p>Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the downtrend line, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the breakout.

Whether you're new to crypto or a seasoned degenerate, you gotta be on your toes these days. The scammers are coming for everyone.<br /><br />But don't let the thieves get you down! There's still time to hop onto BlockDAG, Ethereum, Solana, and Aptos before they take off like rockets - you snooze, you lose (literally)! Bitcoin is doing okay with its 10% weekly gain thanks to some decent ETF inflows, but that key resistance level it needs to crush is holding strong. Michael Saylor's been buying up all the Bitcoin he can find, creating a synthetic shortage that'll make access more expensive for everyone else - nice try, MicroStrategy!<br /><br />The Russia-Ukraine situation might be calming down with peace talks making progress and that could lead to lessened sanctions - but don't get too comfortable, markets are still volatile. Arctic Pablo Coin is on the rise (along with Dogecoin and Test Coin) so keep an eye out for that one! Bitget is taking a hit from VOXEL arbitrage, coughing up over 20 million in losses and promising to reimburse users via some sweet airdrops - good move!<br /><br />And finally, Solana's trying to recover from its correction with price approaching major resistance at $170-$188 - it's now or never!",
