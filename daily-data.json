While this target is more conservative than Zhao’s long-range forecast, it aligns with growing market confidence in crypto’s ongoing recovery and potential growth.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"529\" src=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-07-at-2.44.16%E2%80%AFAM-1024x529.png\" alt=\"Source: X\" srcset=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-07-at-2.44.16 https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/05/06/deep-diving-into-czs-bold-bitcoin-price-prediction/AM-1024x529.png 1024w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-07-at-2.44.16 https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/05/06/deep-diving-into-czs-bold-bitcoin-price-prediction/AM-300x155.png 300w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-07-at-2.44.16 https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/05/06/deep-diving-into-czs-bold-bitcoin-price-prediction/AM-768x397.png 768w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-07-at-2.44.16 https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/05/06/deep-diving-into-czs-bold-bitcoin-price-prediction/AM-1536x794.png 1536w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-07-at-2.44.16 https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/05/06/deep-diving-into-czs-bold-bitcoin-price-prediction/AM-150x78.png 150w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-07-at-2.44.16 https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/05/06/deep-diving-into-czs-bold-bitcoin-price-prediction/AM-696x360.png 696w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-07-at-2.44.16 https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/05/06/deep-diving-into-czs-bold-bitcoin-price-prediction/AM-1068x552.png 1068w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-07-at-2.44.16 https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/05/06/deep-diving-into-czs-bold-bitcoin-price-prediction/AM-1920x992.png 1920w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-07-at-2.44.16 https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/05/06/deep-diving-into-czs-bold-bitcoin-price-prediction/AM.png 2036w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>Source: X</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The broader crypto market has also seen increased trading volume and investment inflows, further strengthening the case for continued bullish momentum. The market continues to attract institutional attention and retail interest, particularly as the regulatory outlook becomes more favorable in key jurisdictions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from price predictions, Zhao also covered some broader trends moving the crypto space. He expressed worry about memecoins out of hand, noting that most are devoid of value and distract from more valuable blockchain development. Zhao stressed the importance of artificial intelligence and decentralized science (deSci) to the crypto ecosystem, both of which he called long-term bets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CZ noted that AI and blockchain could see deeper integration in the future, opening new use cases across industries. In the field of decentralized science, Zhao mentioned the role of crypto in incentivizing global innovation and funding new research models outside traditional systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-regulatory-shifts-and-the-future-of-exchanges\"><strong>Regulatory Shifts and the Future of Exchanges</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Zhao pointed out the changing regulatory stance in the United States, crediting the current administration under President Donald Trump for taking a more favorable approach toward digital assets. He described this shift as a marked departure from earlier positions taken by U.S. authorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also discussed the progression of trading infrastructure. Centalized exchanges (CEXs) make it easier to bring users aboard but, in the long run Zhao thinks decentralized exchanges (DEXs) will grow larger. Instead, he called both models alternative ways to access the same blockchain economy, not different systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The four-month prison sentence Zhao received last year fundamentally changed his personal goals. Prioritizing health and family, he is not looking to return as Binance CEO. Though he said he would be interested in a formal pardon, his chief focus now is on advising emerging crypto founders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zhao also said he’s backing other projects run on decentralized protocols and plans to support even more behind the scenes. He doesn’t count on having any leadership of any new ventures, but plans on staying in the space as a coach and guide.</p>\n</div><div data-td-block-uid=\"tdi_123\">\n\n<p><h4><span>Disclaimer</span></h4></p><p>The contents of this page are intended for general informational purposes and do not constitute financial, investment, or any other form of advice.

The legislation, initiated in January 2025, represents a significant step in state-level cryptocurrency adoption.</p>\n<p>This development is pivotal, with potential ripple effects on state investment strategies and corporate interest in digital assets. The bill’s implementation may spark similar actions in other regions.</p>\n<h2>New Hampshire’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Takes Shape</h2>\n<p>Governor Chris Sununu of New Hampshire officially signed the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve into law on May 6, 2025. This landmark legislation enables the state treasury to invest in Bitcoin and other digital assets.

The bill mandates that assets be managed through compliant exchange products. The approval of this legislation signals a shift towards state integration of cryptocurrencies in public finance strategies.</p>\n\n<blockquote>The successful passage of House Bill 302 reflects our commitment to exploring modern financial avenues for state investments and embracing the future of currency. – <a href=\"https://defi-planet.com/2025/04/new-hampshire-senate-panel-approves-bitcoin-reserve-bill/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DeFi Planet</a></blockquote>\n<h2>Bitcoin Market Valuation and Legislation Impact</h2>\n<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Bitcoin’s circulating supply is approaching its capped limit of 21 million coins, making it a deflationary asset.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin’s current market valuation reflects both community confidence and potential volatility. As of CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin trades at $97,018.64, with over $1.93 trillion in market valuation.

After slipping below the $0.1750 support zone earlier in May, the meme coin price rebounded sharply over the weekend. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts and on-chain indicators are beginning to signal the formation of a local bottom and the possibility of a strong bullish reversal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-dogecoin-price-breaks-downtrend-channel-and-retests-0-1750\"><strong>Dogecoin Price Breaks Downtrend Channel and Retests $0.1750</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the hourly chart, DOGE price broke out of a defined descending channel, ending a short-term bearish trend that had weighed on prices for several days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The breakout occurred near $0.1720, a level marked by heavy intraday resistance. Following the breakout, <a href=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/05/04/can-dogecoin-price-surge-to-5-amid-whale-accumulation/\">Dogecoin price</a> rallied past the $0.1750 level and now consolidates just above that zone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This breakout pattern was first <a href=\"https://x.com/TATrader_Alan/status/1919318935582986602\">identified</a> by Trader Tardigrade, who pointed to the bullish structure on the one-hour timeframe. The move marked the first technical signal of strength for DOGE since its rejection from $0.182 in late April.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"680\" height=\"490\" src=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-228.png\" alt=\"Source: Trader Tardigrade, X\" srcset=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-228.png 680w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-228-300x216.png 300w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-228-150x108.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption>Source: Trader Tardigrade, X</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>According to current support levels, $0.1685 and $0.16 50 remain key downside zones to watch. Meanwhile, overhead resistance lies at $0.1780, $0.1850, and the $0.20 psychological level. If these levels are cleared, analysts suggest a mid-term path could form toward $0.50 and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-long-term-analysts-point-to-structural-bottom-formation-on-dogecoin-price\"><strong>Long-Term Analysts Point to Structural Bottom Formation on Dogecoin Price</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional bullish signals have emerged from long-term chart watchers. According to the Investments CEO, the DOGE/USDT weekly chart <a href=\"https://x.com/Investments_CEO/status/1919045245305602347\">showed</a>a clear higher low and a trendline retest. The analyst shared a chart indicating a projected breakout that may extend as high as $1.16 in the next major leg up, should the current setup hold.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"680\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-226.png\" alt=\"Source: CEO, X\" srcset=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-226.png 680w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-226-300x231.png 300w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-226-150x116.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption>Source: CEO, X</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Echoing this view, pseudonymous analyst Astronomer <a href=\"https://x.com/astronomer_zero/status/1918917720307093715\">noted</a> that DOGE price may have already bottomed after establishing support near $0.165. Drawing comparisons to October 2024, when Dogecoin price rallied over 500%, the analyst highlighted a similar structure forming now. The thesis is based on high time-frame market cycles, with altcoins typically finding their lows shortly after Bitcoin does.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"680\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-225.png\" alt=\"Source: Astronomer, X\" srcset=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-225.png 680w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-225-300x124.png 300w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-225-150x62.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption>Source: Astronomer, X</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Astronomer added that spot holdings and defined risk zones near current levels make DOGE price an attractive asymmetric opportunity. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 2-day chart is also showing a mild bullish divergence, which often precedes trend reversals in such macro structures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-whale-activity-sparks-accumulation-speculation\"><strong>Whale Activity Sparks Accumulation Speculation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent on-chain data further supports the possibility of renewed accumulation. A large transaction involving 100 million DOGE, worth approximately $17.5 million, was moved to a private wallet earlier this week. This transfer coincided with increased exchange outflows, often interpreted as a bullish signal when coins are moved off platforms for long-term storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some wallet groups continue to show distribution patterns, particularly those holding 10 million to 100 million DOGE, wallets with larger holdings have reversed their behavior. Wallets with between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE resumed net buying since April 8th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of active addresses in the system has not increased a lot recently. Daily activity matches only 3.4% of the high mark from November 2023. The slow retail buying activity shows the retail market still faces challenges, while larger investors drive these latest price increases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-metrics-show-divergence-between-cap-and-realized-value\"><strong>Metrics Show Divergence Between Cap and Realized Value</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Between early April and May 6, Dogecoin’s market capitalization rose from $21 billion to $26.4 billion. But the realized cap, which measures coins’ value according to their last move price, fell slightly from $21.5 billion to $21.3 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In particular, this divergence implies a portion of the recent increase of price is driven by speculative trades rather than by strong on-chain fundamentals. The rally is being held by conviction holders rather than widespread retail demand, as long-term holders have not significantly increased selling activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to technical analysts, a strong breakout will only happen when <a href=\"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/price-prediction/dogecoin/\">DOGE price</a> stays above $0.1850 and reaches $0.20 levels. A successful journey over $0.1850 would signal a path toward a technical retest of $0.28 to $0.30 and push the market towards $0.50 and $1.16 when all conditions turn bullish.</p>\n</div><div data-td-block-uid=\"tdi_123\">\n\n<p><h4><span>Disclaimer</span></h4></p><p>The contents of this page are intended for general informational purposes and do not constitute financial, investment, or any other form of advice.

    "text": "The crypto market is getting all hopped up as Gold and Bitcoin are both soaring ahead of today's Fed decision - but don't get too excited, because the SEC still has some tricks up its sleeve in the Ripple lawsuit, just to keep things interesting.<br /><br />In other news, Solana might be worth $420 by end-2025 if it gets a boost from a potential new Bitcoin high (but retailers aren't so sure about that), while Zerebro's price is plummeting as rumors swirl around co-founder Jeffy Yu's death being a ruse. Meanwhile CZ says Bitcoin will hit $1m, DEXs will rule CEXs long-term and AI/DeSci are crypto's next frontier.<br /><br />Gold prices are up 0.7% to $3,357 per ounce ahead of today's Fed decision while Bitcoin is hovering near February highs around $97,500 - which could be just the beginning as Middle East unrest, new Trump-era tariffs and safe-haven demand push up Gold and Bitcoin. Canaan gets upgraded to \"buy\" by Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer who says diversifying revenue streams through North American expansion will boost its stock (he sets a $3 price target, 5x the current level), but the quiet mempool and flat volume on Bitcoin's blockchain could mean limited fuel for its breakout above $100k.<br /><br />High-level economic talks between China and the US could shake up global financial markets as high-ranking officials meet in Switzerland to discuss trade relations.",
