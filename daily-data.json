He argued that AI’s real value will emerge when it gains the ability to manage both crypto-native and tokenized real-world assets onchain.</p>\n\n<p>“There’s no reason why we shouldn’t have real estate onchain,” Ching said. “There’s no reason why we shouldn’t have stocks, bonds, treasuries, money market funds, pre-IPOs. All that stuff should move onchain over time.”</p>\n<h2>From Personalized Portfolios to Onchain Lending</h2>\n\n<p>Ching envisions a future where AI agents construct customized portfolios for individual users, selecting from a wide array of onchain assets tailored to their financial goals. With more real-world assets becoming tokenized, AI could tap into unprecedented levels of data and accessibility to optimize financial decision-making at scale.</p>\n<p>Moreover, tokenized assets like real estate could open the door to new decentralized finance (<a>DeFi</a>) applications — including using those assets as collateral for loans.</p>\n\n\n<h2>AI Agents for All, and <a>Blockchain</a> as a Truth Anchor</h2>\n<p>Looking ahead, Ching predicts that AI agents could become as commonplace as smartphones — if not more so. “I suspect at least one per person, if not multiple,” he added.</p>\n<p>He also proposed that blockchains could play a key role in combating misinformation. By storing hashed, immutable versions of content like interviews or official statements, blockchains could verify the authenticity and timestamp of information—serving as a digital anchor of truth in an era of deepfakes and AI-generated falsehoods.</p>\n<p>As the lines blur between artificial intelligence and decentralized systems, Ching’s vision places blockchain not just as a tool for value transfer, but as a foundational infrastructure for the AI-driven economy of the future.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/352935/aptos-labs-ceo-ai-agents\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source</a></strong></p><!-- CONTENT END 1 -->\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://t.me/coindoo_media\">\n        <img alt=\"telegram\" width=\"932\" height=\"236\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/themes/coinpress/images/Banner_en-US_Poppins_new.png\">\n    </a>\n</p><section>\n    <span>Author</span>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n                                <p><img width=\"298\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/photo_2025-03-25_16-09-58-298x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/photo_2025-03-25_16-09-58-298x300.jpg 298w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/photo_2025-03-25_16-09-58-398x400.jpg 398w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/photo_2025-03-25_16-09-58-768x772.jpg 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/photo_2025-03-25_16-09-58.jpg 1170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px\">                </p>\n                                            \n            </div>\n                <p>Kosta has been a part of the team since 2021 and has solidified his position with a thirst for knowledge, incredible dedication to his work and a \"detective-like\" mindset.

Cambodian authorities have already taken action: the National Bank of Cambodia revoked the company’s license in March, citing violations of domestic rules banning digital asset activity by payment processors.</p>\n<p>The case underscores growing concerns among global regulators about the role of loosely regulated platforms in enabling cyber-enabled financial crime—especially those tied to hostile nation-states.</p><!-- CONTENT END 1 -->\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://t.me/coindoo_media\">\n        <img alt=\"telegram\" width=\"932\" height=\"236\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/themes/coinpress/images/Banner_en-US_Poppins_new.png\">\n    </a>\n</p><section>\n    <span>Author</span>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n                                <p><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-300x300.jpg 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-400x400.jpg 400w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-768x768.jpg 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-600x600.jpg 600w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n.jpg 1372w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\">                </p>\n                                            \n            </div>\n                <p>Alex is an experienced finance journalist and a cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiast.

Risk-adjusted performance improved as well, with higher Sharpe ratios and only a slight bump in drawdowns. The key, the report emphasizes, is consistent rebalancing—ideally monthly—to prevent <a>volatility</a> from compounding over time.</p>\n\n<p>Why Dogecoin? According to the firm, its relatively low correlation with both traditional finance and the broader crypto market, along with a history of outsized gains, makes it more than just a speculative meme—it acts as a genuine diversifier.</p>\n\n\n<p>21Shares also offered projections for Dogecoin’s possible price trajectory this cycle. In a conservative scenario, if the token grows at 10% annually from its 2021 high of $0.73, it could reach around $0.38 by the end of 2025—more than doubling from today’s prices, but still falling short of a new record.</p>\n<p>A middle-ground estimate assumes Dogecoin retains a 3% slice of a crypto market that swells to $5 trillion. That would place its <a>market cap</a> at roughly $150 billion, suggesting a price of about $1.</p>\n<p>The bullish view borrows from historical growth trends. If DOGE repeats its past compounded annual growth rate of 189%—measured from the 2018 low to the 2022 cycle bottom—it could climb as high as $1.42. That outcome would require strong retail momentum, broader utility, and further integration into major platforms, such as Elon Musk’s X.</p>\n<p>For investors willing to take a structured and disciplined approach, 21Shares argues that Dogecoin may be more than a passing internet fad—it might just be a smart risk.</p><!-- CONTENT END 1 -->\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://t.me/coindoo_media\">\n        <img alt=\"telegram\" width=\"932\" height=\"236\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/themes/coinpress/images/Banner_en-US_Poppins_new.png\">\n    </a>\n</p><section>\n    <span>Author</span>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n                                <p><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-300x300.jpg 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-400x400.jpg 400w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-768x768.jpg 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-600x600.jpg 600w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n.jpg 1372w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\">                </p>\n                                            \n            </div>\n                <p>Alex is an experienced finance journalist and a cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiast.

This mounting demand has significantly tightened the available supply in the market.</p>\n\n<p>Leading the charge is Strategy, which has added over 107,000 BTC so far this year, accounting for more than 65% of all Bitcoin mined in 2025. While Strategy remains the most aggressive buyer, other publicly traded firms, mining companies, and treasury allocators are steadily joining the trend.</p>\n\n\n<p>This year’s accumulation follows a blistering pace set in 2024, when corporations and institutions snapped up nearly four times more Bitcoin than was mined. Public companies were responsible for over 330,000 BTC, <a>ETF</a> issuers bought more than 500,000, and private firms slightly reduced exposure.</p>\n<p>Though ETF inflows have slowed compared to last year’s initial surge—adding only about 35,000 BTC so far in 2025—their impact remains substantial. The majority of new Bitcoin continues to be absorbed by long-term holders, limiting market <a>liquidity</a> and reinforcing the narrative of Bitcoin as a corporate and institutional reserve asset.</p>\n<p>The result is a supply dynamic increasingly defined by reduced float and multi-year holding strategies, which could shape Bitcoin’s market behavior well beyond the current cycle.</p><!-- CONTENT END 1 -->\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://t.me/coindoo_media\">\n        <img alt=\"telegram\" width=\"932\" height=\"236\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/themes/coinpress/images/Banner_en-US_Poppins_new.png\">\n    </a>\n</p><section>\n    <span>Author</span>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n                                <p><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-300x300.jpg 300w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-400x400.jpg 400w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-768x768.jpg 768w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n-600x600.jpg 600w, https://coindoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/87288096_2884551631567020_6469815456248102912_n.jpg 1372w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\">                </p>\n                                            \n            </div>\n                <p>Alex is an experienced finance journalist and a cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiast.

This is a classic bullish signal that frequently signals the start of a longer-term trend reversal. At $96,516, <a href=\"https://u.today/bitcoin-btc-makes-420-million-comeback-in-24-hours-unexpected-u-turn\">Bitcoin</a> is still above all significant moving averages and has recovered significant ground that was lost during the February-March breakdown. Although it indicates underlying strength and a change in trend, the golden cross is not a guarantee of sudden sharp price swings.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The present price range, which is close to the point of the early 2025 breakdown, may actually serve as both structural and psychological resistance. A short-term pullback is becoming more likely as the asset consolidates following a strong rally - especially as the RSI approaches overbought territory at 69. But sentiment is not just about technical aspects. On May 1, net inflows of $422 million were made into Bitcoin spot ETFs, with BlackRock's IBIT leading the way with $351 million.</p><figure><img alt=\"Article image\" src=\"https://u.today/sites/default/files/inline-images/image_2058.png\" data-entity-uuid=\"a88506ff-fe95-4d20-8e52-c8edfaa7dfc3\" data-entity-type=\"file\"><figcaption><a rel=\"dofollow\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/\">BTC/USDT Chart by TradingView</a></figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">This indicates a strong institutional appetite. These kinds of inflows give Bitcoin a strong foundation and may protect it from a decline. <a href=\"https://u.today/ethereum-whales-are-back-out-of-nowhere\">Ethereum</a> ETF activity, on the other hand, was much lower, with a net inflow of $6.49 million and outflows only reported by Grayscale's ETHE. Even with the momentum, it would be beneficial to take a break here. The precise range where Bitcoin's last breakdown started has been reached again; markets frequently pause when they return to these areas.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Resetting the RSI, shaking out weak hands and laying the groundwork for a possible breakout above $100,000 would all be accomplished by a consolidation between $94,000 and $97,000. In summary, the golden cross indicates that although the macro trend for Bitcoin is turning bullish, short-term prudence is still necessary.</p> <h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"h265177\">XRP's volatility surge</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">The asset has now arrived at the very tip of a converging wedge, which is made up of a recently constructed ascending support trendline and a long-standing descending resistance line after spending months stuck in a descending triangle pattern.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">With a current price of about $2.19, <a href=\"https://u.today/xrp-300-million-in-48-hours-gone-whats-next\">XRP</a> is sandwiched between a rising trendline that has been protecting bulls since early April and a downtrend that has dominated price action since January.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The textbook volatility pinch that results from this configuration frequently comes before a strong breakout — or a precipitous breakdown. Volume has been decreasing, which is common for assets that are getting close to the top of this kind of structure.</p><div>\n                    <p>You Might Also Like</p>\n                    <div>\n                      <p><img src=\"https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/300/public/2025-05/1000032876.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" alt=\"Title news\"></p>\n                      \n                    </div>\n                  </div><p dir=\"ltr\">Around 52, the RSI is neutral, indicating that neither buyers nor sellers have complete control. The indecisiveness and coiling of price pressure are reinforced by the EMA's close, clustering at 50, 100 and 200. XRP would confirm a pattern breakout with a possible measured move aiming for the $2.70-$3.00 zone if it breaks above the descending resistance, which is currently at about $2.23 on strong volume.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">An aggressive short-term gain could be possible as a result of this strong continuation signal. However, a pullback toward $1.98, testing the 200 EMA and possibly shaking weak hands before any sustained upward move, could result from a rejection at the current levels or from the inability to hold the ascending support near $2.17.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"h365177\">Solana in difficult position</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">When Solana's price action starts to resemble a classic double-top formation, a bearish pattern that usually precedes reversals, it may be giving traders an early warning sign. Currently trading at $148, SOL is having difficulty breaking above the resistance level between $150 and $152, which corresponds to its previous local high.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The stage is set for a possible trend reversal when this level is not reached on the second attempt. The convergence of overhead resistance such as the 100-day EMA and the still-distant 200-day EMA are in favor to this bearish scenario. The price has shown exhaustion following a strong rally from April lows near $115, and it is currently stalling just below those zones.</p><div>\n                    <p>You Might Also Like</p>\n                    <div>\n                      <p><img src=\"https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/300/public/2025-05/58010.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" alt=\"Title news\"></p>\n                      \n                    </div>\n                  </div><p dir=\"ltr\">Bulls who depend solely on momentum to push higher should be wary of the RSI, which is just under 60 and indicates cooling momentum without being oversold. Another indication of waning buyer interest is the volume starting to taper off as the price approaches resistance. It is more likely that <a href=\"https://u.today/can-bitcoin-btc-reach-100000-now-solanas-sol-coming-back-to-fundamentals-dogecoin-doge-ready-to\">SOL</a> will drop quickly toward the 50-day EMA near $132 if it is unable to maintain above the $140 support, which is the neckline of this possible double-top.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A verified collapse below that would allow for more significant retracements, perhaps as much as $110 or even $120. This arrangement should be closely monitored by investors. Solana looks susceptible to a brief correction even though the overall market is holding up. Before making a strong comeback, conservative traders might think about derisking or holding off until there is a verified breakout above the $152 resistance.</p>\n            \n                                                                                            </div></div>",

Or maybe we're just getting to the good stuff.<br /><br />Avery Ching, CEO of Aptos Labs, is spouting some wild pipe dreams about AI agents running your crypto assets like a robo-banker, promising us all a smarter economy where blockchain verifies the truth (cue deepfakes). Meanwhile, Trump's dinner party just turned into a disaster as his five high-roller buddies sold 126K tokens on Bybit and sent TRUMP plummeting. <br /><br />On the regulatory front, the IRS is cracking down on a Cambodian firm accused of laundering over $4 billion, including North Korean cash. We're not sure how much this will affect your tax bill, but it's good to know someone's keeping an eye on those shady operators. The Dogecoin cultists have new ammo, though - a study from 21Shares says even a little DOGE can go a long way in boosting returns with minimal risk.<br /><br />In more serious news, New York is shoveling out $2 billion in \"inflation rebates\" to nearly 8 million residents, which has critics crying foul. The move might be an attempt to counterbalance inflation, but it's basically just printing money (again).<br /><br />As the world gets crazier, corporate demand for Bitcoin is going through the roof, pushing institutional investors into buying more coins than new ones are being mined. <br /><br />More News Below:",
